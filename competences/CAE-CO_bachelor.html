			<h1>Academic Requirements for Designation as a CAE in Cyber Operations Fundamental</h1>

			<p>Criterion 1 of the Criteria for Measurement
 specifically addresses the academic requirements for the CAE-Cyber 
Operations Fundamental program. The academic requirements are based on 
Knowledge Units (KUs) (single or multiple courses, or course modules 
within single or multiple courses).</p> 
			
			<p>The program must include KUs covering 100% of the mandatory 
academic content and a minimum of 10 of the 17 optional academic 
content.</p>

			<p>Students meeting the academic criteria for the institution's cyber
 operations program must complete coursework to meet all ten of the 
mandatory KUs and at least four of the optional KUs offered by the 
institution.</p>

			<p>The Outcomes listed in each KU description are examples of the 
level of depth cyber operations students must demonstrate to meet the 
requirement.</p>

include programming assignments to demonstrate that students are capable
 of the desired outcomes)</strong>
                    <p>Low level programming allows programmers to 
construct programs that interact with a system without the layers of 
abstraction that are provided by many high level languages. Proficiency 
in low-level programming languages is required to perform key roles in 
the cyber operations field (e.g., forensics, malware analysis, exploit 
development).</p> 
                    <p>Specific languages required to satisfy this knowledge unit are:</p> 
                    <ul>

 or via other courses that require significant programming to 
demonstrate the students have the requisite skill described in the 
outcomes.</p> </li>

                    <p>The discipline of reverse engineering provides 
the ability to deduce the design of a software component, to determine 
how something works (i.e., recover the software specification), discover
 data used by software, and to aid in the analysis of software via 
disassembly and/or decompilation. The ability to understand software of 
unknown origin or software for which source code is unavailable is a 
critical skill within the cyber operations field. Use cases include 
malware analysis and auditing of closed source software.</p>

include examples of hands-on lab exercises to demonstrate that students 
have achieved mastery of this KU.</p></li>

                <li><strong>M.3 Operating System Theory</strong>
                    <p>Operating systems (OS) provide the platform on 
which running software acquires and uses computing resources. Operating 
systems are responsible for working with the underlying hardware to 
provide the baseline security capabilities of a system. Understanding 
the underlying theory of operating system design is critical to cyber 
operations as operating systems control the operation of a computer and 
the allocation of associated resources.</p>

                    <p><em>Outcome</em>: Students will have a thorough 
understanding of how networks work at the infrastructure, network and 
applications layers; how they transfer data; how network protocols work 
to enable communication; and how the lower-level network layers support 
the upper ones. They will have a thorough knowledge of the major network
 protocols that enable communications and data transfer.</p></li>

                    <p>The first fundamental security design principles

 policies can be reliably implemented. When followed, the first 
principles enable the implementation of sound security mechanisms and 
systems. When not completely followed, the risk that an exploitable 
vulnerability may exist is increased. A solid understanding of these 
principles is critical to successful performance in the cyber operations
 domain. </p>

                    <p>In digital electronic systems, logic devices 
provide specific functions, including device-to-device interfacing, data
 communication, signal processing, data display, timing and control 
operations, and several other system functions. Logic devices can be

programmable logic device (PLD) is the ability to use a programmable 
logic language to implement a design into a PLD and immediately test it 
in a live circuit.</p>

networking in everything from user identification and authentication to 
message integrity and cipher synchronization.</p>

capabilities of modern cloud platforms. Cloud computing has implications
 for cyber operations not only as a potential target, but also as an 
extensive resource to bring relatively cheap computing power to solve 
problems (e.g. cracking passwords) which would have been more difficult 
pre-cloud.</p>
