			<h1>Academic Requirements for Designation as a CAE in Cyber Operations Advanced</h1>

			<p>Criterion 1 of the Criteria for Measurement
 specifically addresses the academic requirements for the CAE-Cyber 
Operations Advanced program. The academic requirements are based on 
Knowledge Units (KUs) (single or multiple courses, or course modules 
within single or multiple courses).</p> 

            <p>The CAE-CO Advanced Program has three types of Knowledge 
Unit (KU) components that must be met by applicant schools: Foundational
 KUs, Core KUs and Specialization KUs.  Core and Specialization KUs for 
the CAE-CO Advanced designation must be graduate level offerings. </p>

            <p>Designated programs must graduate a minimum of five 
Master's degree students with a CAE-CO Advanced designation or at 
least one Doctoral student during the designation cycle. Applicant 
institutions must provide coursework to satisfy at least 3 Core KUs and 2
 Specialization KUs.</p>
            
            <p>Cyber Operations Foundational KUs represent the required 
knowledge for any cyber operations student and must be met either before
 entering or at completion of the graduate cyber operations program. The
 Cyber Operations Foundational KUs are the ten CAE-Cyber Operations 
Fundamental Mandatory KUs. Each school must use a documented process to 
vet their own students for the required foundational knowledge. Vetting 
can be any documented process (e.g. transcript reviews, testing, 
remediation courses, etc).</p>

            <p>Students can also meet Foundational Knowledge Unit 
requirements through graduate level courses (e.g. a student does not 
have an undergraduate Software Reverse Engineering course, but the 
graduate program has Advanced Software Reverse Engineering); taking the 
equivalent graduate course fulfills both the Foundational and Core KU 
requirements.</p>

            <p>Core KUs are key areas set by NSA and are determined by 
DoD and IC Community mission need. CAE-CO Advanced schools are required 
to offer, at a minimum, three of the five Core KUs. Master's 
candidates are required to complete at least three of the five Core KUs.
 Doctoral candidates may have the core requirements waived per 
institutional requirements. </p>

            <p>Cyber Operations Specialization KUs are concentrated 
focus areas offered by CAE-CO Advanced schools. Specialization KUs can 
be previously defined but can also be cyber operations foci proposed by 
the school and approved by the CAE-Cyber Operations Program Office. 
Applicant institutions need to provide coursework to satisfy at least 
two Specialization KUs in cyber operations topics. A cyber operations 
Master's student must complete six credit hours in a Cyber Operations 
Specialization KU and either complete a cyber operations thesis or its 
equivalent in another cyber operations topic. Doctoral candidates must 
demonstrate proficiency in three of the five Cyber Operations Core KU 
requirements within their degree program, complete one Cyber Operations 
Specialization KU and complete a dissertation in a cyber operations 
topic.  It is up to the institution to determine how the 6 credit hours 
are achieved (e.g. independent study or course work in a cyber 
operations area).</p>

            <p>A distinctive quality of CAE CO Advanced schools is that 
graduates possess proficiency in cyber operations knowledge, skills, and
 abilities; therefore, evidence of hands-on learning combined with 
strong theory is required in the application.  Institutions should 
articulate in their application: 1) how Core and Specialized KUs are 
implemented within their curriculum, 2) in a manner that combines strong
 theory and practice to produce proficient graduates.</p>

                <li><strong>C.1 Advanced Reverse Engineering</strong> 
                    <p>The discipline of software reverse engineering 
provides the ability to deduce the design of a software component, to 
determine how something works (i.e., recover the software 
specification), discover data used by software, and to aid in the 
analysis of software via disassembly and/or decompilation. The ability 
to understand software of unknown origin or software for which source 
code is unavailable is a critical skill within the cyber operations 
field. Use cases include malware analysis and auditing of closed source 
software.</p>
                    <p>Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are not limited to: </p>

                <li><strong>C.2 Vulnerability Discovery and Exploitation</strong>
                    <p>Understanding patterns of vulnerabilities and 
attacks can allow one to better understand protection, risk mitigation, 
and identify vulnerabilities in new contexts. Vulnerability analysis and
 its relation to exploit development are core skills for one involved in
 cyber operations.</p>

                <li><strong>C.3 Cellular and Mobile Security </strong>
                    <p>As more communications are conducted via mobile 
and cellular technologies, these technologies have become critical (and 
continue to become more critical) to cyber operations. It is important 
for those involved in cyber operations to understand how data is secured
 during processing and transmission of information. </p>

                    <p>Specific topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are not limited to: </p>

understanding networking protocols, resilient network design, security 
issues, and ensuring safe operation. </p>

                    <p>Specific Topics to be covered in this knowledge unit include, but are not limited to: </p>
                    <ul>

                <li><strong>C.5 Operating System Security</strong>
                    <p>Operating systems (OS) provide the platform on 
which running software acquires and uses computing resources. Operating 
systems are responsible for working with the underlying hardware to 
provide the baseline security capabilities of a system. Understanding 
the security models of modern operating systems is critical to cyber 
operations.</p>

            <h2>Specialization Program Content: (Knowledge Units)</h2> 

            <p>Universities must offer two Specialization KUs and 
CAE-Cyber Operations Advanced students must complete one Specialization 
KU and a thesis/dissertation or institutional equivalent in a cyber 
operations topic.  </p>

            <h3><strong>Specialized Cyber Operations KUs</strong></h3>

            <p>Specialization KUs are intended to allow an applicant 
institution to focus on and increase the depth covered in topics of 
relevance to cyber operations. As with the Core KUs, heavy experiential,
 hands-on learning is required for the Specialized KUs. While any of the
 base knowledge units covered in a typical undergraduate offering may be
 pursued, these knowledge units are intended to allow creativity on the 
part of the applicant institution to recognize and advance the state of 
the art in cyber operations. Listed below are some possibilities but 
this list is representative and is not restrictive. </p>
