<h3 align="center"> Abstract </h3>
<p>
How does a lightweight community Certification Authority
("CA") engage in the heavyweight world of PKI and secure
browsing?
</p>

<p>
With the introduction of PKI -- Public Key Infrastructure
-- as a framework that brought together cryptography,
contract law, and institutional views
from postal and telecommunications ministries,
the Internet security framework rapidly became too complex
for individuals and small groups to deal with,
and <i>the Audit</i> stepped into the gulf
to provide a kinder face, in the form of a simple 
opinion or judgement call.
Classically, the audit process oversights a CA
for its suitability for reliance in the root lists
of popular software distributions.
</p>

<p>
Yet, a community of Internet enthusiasts does
not match the classical target customer of an
audit:  little money, loose structures, no
deadlines, self-directed tasking, uncertain
customer list, all inspired by an original
goal of as many free certificates as you can use.
Internet communities can make up for an apparent lack of
professionalism with enthusiasm, numbers, loyalty and
innovative thinking, but does that help or hinder
a formal, criteria-directed audit process?
</p>

<p>
This talk tracks the systems audit of CAcert,
an open-membership CA, as a case
study in auditing versus the open Internet,
community versus professionalism,
quality versus enthusiasm.
It will walk through
the background of "what, why, wherefore an audit,"
look at how CAcert found itself at this point,
and then walk through some big ticket items:
risks/liabilities/obligations; assurance and
what's in a name; disputes and reliance;
privacy and data protection;
the mission of a CA;
open governance;
and systems and security.
</p>

<p>
Can CAcert deliver on its goal of free certs?
The audit is into its 3rd year as of this
writing; and remains incomplete.
Some parts are going well, and other
parts are not;  by the end of the year 2008,
we should be able to check all of the important
areas, or rethink the process completely.
Hence, finally, the talk will close with
progress and status, and recommendations
for the future.

<p>
This is a deep and open
examination of an
audit of an open Certification Authority,
CAcert.
    <small>[<a href="#ref_1" name="back_1">1</a>]</small>. 

It seeks a broad, more open and fuller style as a
business briefing,
rather than a detailed coverage of technical issues.

All readers should expect to come in for
criticism, participants should put their hard hats on.
The coverage is open, "warts and all,"
because the need is to improve, not pat
anyone on the back.
Many observers of CAcert have come and gone,
knowing all is not well, and I think it is
futile and insulting to hide the rather spotty past.
Better, I propose, to present to the world a message of

</i></blockquote>
<p>
Getting better, each day.
</p>


<h2 id="history">  1.  A Short History of Auditing </h2>

<h3>  In the beginning... </h3>

<p>
In the beginning, there was nothing:
no net, no browser, no root, and no list of roots.
Then, one was added.
One net, One browser, One root,
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>In the beginning...</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Nothing.
    </li><li>
    One.
    </li><li>
    Another ...
    </li><li>
    and another and another ...
    </li><li>
    Many
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
And then, another root, and another.
</p>

<p>
A list of roots!
Which created a need for management.
Who's roots go on the list?
What's the process?
What are the requirements?
</p>

<p>
For a while, root lists were managed by
a more or less informal process that emerged
from the market forces.
The process involved
negotiating with the software vendors (always),
paying a fee (sometimes), and being nice (probably).

</p>

<h3>  The CA Systems Audit </h3>

<blockquote><i>
"Sometimes when you fill a vacuum, it still sucks."
</i><br>
<small> Rob Pike, referring to something or other </small>
</blockquote>

<p>
It was into this vacuum that the accounting profession
stepped, and created the leading expectation
that the one, true, major requirement for
being added to the root list was:
<blockquote><i>
 the systems audit.
</i></blockquote>
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Need to Manage</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Vacuum.
    </li><li>
    Systems audit.
    </li><li>
    Pros:  fixes known things.
    </li><li>
    Cons:  costly, signal.
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
The CA Systems Audit was created by the
auditing profession, suggesting
that CAs be audited on the same basis as other
major IT security systems,
a business in which the accounting profession
already had a large stake.
For example, WebTrust was created by
the auditors in the USA and Canada,
while ETSI was created by ????
</p>

<p>
Although an audit from an accounting firm can add value,
it can also cause undue costs, and it can provide mixed
or confusing signals.
Does an audit signal that a CA is good enough?
Good enough for what?
And how do we know this?
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Cons - Meaning</b></center>
  <ul><li>

    Certificate claim?  To?
    </li><li>
    Signature meaning?  For?
    </li><li>
    Practice.
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
The audit process seems to have generated more than
its fair share of criticism.
Salient criticisms include:
</p>

<ul><li>
    Does not defend the interests
    of the other parties.
    <ul><li>
        Does not make useful statement to
        relying parties, neither vendors nor end-users.
      </li><li>
        Does not make clear what a certificate claims.
      </li><li>
        Does not make clear what the certificate's signature means.
      </li><li>
        Does not align to vendor practice.
        E.g., <i>"all CAs are equal"</i> is not reflected.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>
    The process itself is closed:
    <ul><li>
        Is intended for "qualified accountants" only.
      </li><li>
        Parts may be undisclosed.
      </li><li>
        Intellectual property claims 
        suggest that it cannot be used

    Has not been (properly) updated since its inception.
    <ul><li>
        The threat scenario has!

These criticisms may apply more or less to any of the
variants, here they are listed without favour.

<h3>  Mozilla's Dilemma </h3>

<p>
The informality of the root-list management process
was the norm until competition in browsers started
up again, around 2003.
It worked well enough in the days of no competition, being
roughly that period after Internet Explorer destroyed
Netscape (the company and the browser) as a viable competitor,
up until the arisal, phoenix-like, of Firefox.
Where there is no competitive pressure, then the market
leader does what it likes, and others follow or not,
as they like.
No clear guidelines, no strong rationale
for one standard over another, and no commonality
is required when there is a dominant player.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Mozilla's Dilemma</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Mozilla's CA policy
    </li><li>
    Existing Audits did what?
    </li><li>
    Audits can be open.
    </li><li>
    Policy adds: criteria and review (uber-audit)
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
As Firefox started to show signs of success, questions
arose as to how to "get into Firefox."  Especially,
loud and irritable competitors to established CAs asked
these questions, as the path to their success lay through
the root lists.  Firefox then was the first port of call
in those negotiations, because as the new challenger, it
was small, light, nimble and thus the trend setter.
Further, as an open product, an open approach to the root
list was something that people thought was appropriate.
</p>

<p>
To Mozilla's eternal credit, these questions were seriously
taken.  Mozilla appointed Frank Hecker (later CEO of Mozilla
Foundation until end 2007) to head a 2 year project to create
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/policy/">
a policy for ascension to the root list</a>.
This process was openly conducted on the public mailing list
know as "mozilla-security" and archives will track the full
debate.  It took 2 years, thousands of emails, and the attention
of many people.
</p>

<p>
The topic was briskly fought.  Especially, the question of
openness in audits was debated.  Many felt that the audit
should be conducted to the highest standards, and that was
felt to be the WebTrust process established many years ago.
</p>

<p>
Others challenged this process on many grounds.
However, in the event, the debate was resolved by allegations
made by the very defenders of the audit process that certain
of the WebTrust-audited CAs were conducting activities that
no auditor should have approved (they said) and were directly
against the interests of Mozilla users, and therefore against
the interests of Mozilla.
</p>

<p>
What these interesting activities were, was never resolved,
but rapidly, the group moved to promote a policy of openness,
even to the extent of accepting an open and independent
audit process.  (It should be said, to be fair, that the
notion of not relying on an audit at all was not seriously
explored.)
</p>

<h3>  CAcert's Dilemma </h3>

<p>
This extraordinary departure opened the door to allowing
open CAs such as CAcert to conduct open audits,
but the issue was not solved, only simplified;
the audit still
needed to be conducted to external and independent criteria.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>CAcert's Dilemma</b></center>

    Audit was still needed
    </li><li>
    mid 2005:  David Ross:  Criteria
    </li><li>
    early 2006:  Ian Grigg:  Auditor
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>


<p>
Enter David Ross, a frequent contributer to the above mentioned
debate.  As a critic of CAcert, and as a long-term quality
engineer, he was encouraged to start an audit of CAcert on
the basis of the emerging policy.
Ross did not get as far as starting the audit, but he did
write out
<a href="http://rossde.com/CA_review/">a new criteria</a>
that updated the old, venerable
WebTrust version.
Ross found other commitments in the way of attendance
on the Grand Jury of his domicile.
</p>

<p>
At this point, Ian Grigg then stepped forward and agreed
to audit CAcert on the basis of the criteria written by
David Ross (henceforth, "DRC").
He, or I, was a long-standing critic of the
entire process, so is apparently well versed in at
least the weaknesses.
</p>

<h3> Mission of audit </h3>

<p>
The initiation of the audit
and consequent mission was driven primarily by Mozilla's
requirement for an audit to get into the latter's root list
for its products (Firefox and Thunderbird).
</p>


<p>
The process of the audit then was driven by
(a) the Mozilla policy, which resulted in
(b) the criteria known as DRC (discussed below).
The choices found therein were informed by several circumstances,
</p>

<ul><li>
    Mozilla's transparency on the root question.
    <ul><li>
        Mozilla is an open source organisation, so in
        principle aligns with other open organisations.
      </li><li>
        Mozilla ran an open security discussion
        maillist which at
        least presents a forum of
        communication on such matters.
      </li><li>
        Mozilla engaged in a strong, open project to
        create a fair and strong policy for the topic
        at hand.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>
    CAcert's founder,
    the author of the criteria, and
    the current auditor,
    were all to be found at one time or another
    assisting the Mozilla audit project
    (as archived in the mozilla-security list).
  </li><li>
    David Ross's history as a quality engineer,
    and my history in payment systems and
    financial cryptography.
  </li><li>
    Mozilla's fast growth.
    At current time musters around 20-30% of the market.
</li></ul>

<p>
The audit may or may not be applicable or exandable
for other purposes.
What was still not clear from the origins was what the
overall goal of the audit was.
After much thought and much experience,
the following mission was suggested.
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellspacing="5"><tr><th>
To review and report on the suitability of CAcert's CA<br>
to enter the root list of Mozilla Foundation.
</th></tr></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
However this is somewhat unedifying.  In practice the higher
goal has been something like:
</p>


<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellspacing="5"><tr><th>
To review and report on the suitability of CAcert's CA<br>
to present certificates to,<br>
and provide some utility and protection to,<br>
end-users of browsers such as Mozilla's.
</th></tr></table>
</blockquote>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center>Mission in Practice</center>
  <ul><li>
    <i>"report on entering Mozilla's root list"</i>
    </li><li>
    not very edifying?
    <center>
    </li><li>
    <blockquote><b><i>
    "Do CAcert's certs give<br>
    utility + protection<br>
    to end-users?"
    </i></b></blockquote>
  </li></li>
   
</center>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
That is, unlike other processes, CAcert has specifically
moved away from following the flavour of the audit process,
and incorporated the end-user as the real customer.
This has some ramifications, some trivial and some quite
severe, which we shall see soon enough.
</p>



<h2 id="drc">  2. Introduction to the Criteria </h2>


<p>
The criteria, ("<a href="http://rossde.com/CA_review/">DRC</a>")
are divided into 3 groups or phases,
being A (documentation), B (public access),
and C (operational review).
Within those broad areas there are subsets.
Like all tree-structured representations, there are
substantial horizontal threads, although these are
less well defined.
</p>

<p>
A full description is best done through reading the source.
Here is a summary of the main areas:

<h3> Comparison with other Criteria </h3>

<p>
How then does DRC compare to other criteria?
In essence, there are these differences to
WebTrust:

  <ul><li>

<ul><li>

  </li><li>
    DRC applies a similar (if not unified) control framework
    to documents (policies), software, hardware and roots.
  </li><li>
    DRC requires the statement by the CA of
    risks, liabilities and obligations for
    most of the parties.
    See below.
  </li><li>
    DRC is oriented towards the end-user,
    and not so much to the CA.
</li></ul>

<!-- I think this was a comment to author:  <i><b>More to be done?</b></i> -->

<h2 id="early">  3. Early Easy Issues </h2>

<p>
For CAcert, the criteria introduced several
big issues, which were in retropsect solved easily.
</p>

<h3> Configuration-Control Specification </h3>

<p>
In common with most quality processes the DRC identifies
a set of important and therefore controlled documents.
DRC-A establishes the Configuration-Control Specification
("CCS")
as the set of documents and control policies for those documents
that are considered to be so important to the CA's integrity
and good functioning, that they form a part of the audit.
In other words, the "controlled" set.
</p>

<p>
From the point of view of the process, this part is
simple:  identify the document titles, find them,
or write them, have them approved
(first by the organisation, second by the audit),
and make sure they are being used.
Simple to say, and it hides a lot of work, but
at least this part should have presented no
challenge to the average organisation.
</p>

<h4> History </h4>

<p>
However, CAcert was no <i>average</i> organisation.
When CAcert started, it had little of
this in place.
As of early 2006, the process was that the
Board would approve documents, and a policy maillist existed
as a place to discuss them.
However, few "controlled" sets were identified.
no timeframes were established,
and indeed no forward plan existed at all.
</p>

<h3 id="cps"> Things that can go wrong -- The Trap of Being Too Good </h3>
<p>
An interesting sidebar occurred here.
One document that existed was the CPS, or the
Certification Practice Statement.  This is the
core document for a CA, the one that more or
less describes everything that should be described.
So the presence of the CPS was a good start.
</p>

<p>
It was however owned copyright by another organisation,
and was being used under licence.  This sat oddly with
the overall sense of "control" as pushed by the CCS.
It turned out that the author had (quite valid)
concerns about the
open source pedigree of CAcert, and had deliberately
arranged matters to place the ownership with the
Free Software Foundation, and licence the document
under their Free Document Licence.
</p>

<p>
I pondered this and worried about whether the FSF
could indeed exert pressure over the CA using this.
Although it was unlikely that the FSF would do this
for bad reasons, they might very well try to do it
for what they perceived as good reasons.
To resolve this, several choices were offered:
</p>

<ul><li>

  </li><li>
    audit the Free Document Licence,

</li></ul>

<p>
In short, in negotiations, the FSF confirmed that they
could and might indeed try to control the document
in some sense.
They however suggested that we trust them, as they
had our best interests at heart.
And, no, they were
not going to hand the copyright back.
</p>

<p>
In the end, CAcert elected to rewrite the CPS entirely,
from scratch, and this time keep ownership.
As the document was well short of audit requirements, anyway,
this was the better choice.
To be fair, I never looked at the FDL, but I was told
it was more complex and less understandable than the
famous GPL.  Such seems to be a cruel and unusual punishment,
and at least beyond what you could ask someone to do
in their own free time.
</p>

<h3> Policy On Policy </h3>
<p>
It proved fairly easy for the CA to knock out a list to
match the requirements imposed by DRC-A.  The Privacy Policy
was modified with 3 additional clauses, driven by DRC-A,
and this was approved by the Board.
Slowly, additional documents in the controlled set
were created and brought to some state of usability.
</p>

<p>
However, the process then hit another issue:
the policy for approval itself.  The Board simply
declined to approve anything more complicated than
the three clauses added to the Privacy Policy.
Documents backed up until crisis struck.
</p>


<p>
In response to the backlog of policy approvals,
it was proposed that this very approval
of policy should then migrate to a more consensual style
in the spirit of the IETF.  In brief,
let the entire cycle of policies be done by the community,
on the open policy mailing list.
From proposal, editing, agreement on draft, and right through
to approval of the final document, this could be done on the
open subscription mailing list.
</p>

<p>
To that end, such a policy was drafted as
<a href="http://www.cacert.org/policy/PolicyOnPolicy.php">
Policy On Policy</a>.
This approach reduced the Board problem
from Order(n) to Order(1),
at least, on paper, assuming it could be approved.
The above-mentioned set of backlogged documents could then be
handled more quickly, as could the backlog of other policies
outside the controlled set.
</p>

<p>
The process also creates a gap in governance:  what do
we do with a rogue policy committee.
To deal with this, the policy permits two significant
escape valves.
Firstly, the Board retained a veto over policies
that were in the intermediate stage of DRAFT,
but the right expired when the policies enter their final
concrete status.
Secondly, any user can take the policy to the
forum of dispute resolution and seek a ruling.
The move to <i>Arbitration</i> as a means for internal
dispute resolution, described later, provides this
oversight formerly handled by the Board, albeit in
a novel and untested way.
</p>



<p>
According to its own process, it could be deemed approved.
Yet, to deal with the bootstrapping problem or replacing the
old approval process,
it itself needs to be initially approved by the Board
in order for the CA to proceed on its audit path.
It is fair to say that the sum of these changes are
significant, and in the event, the Board declined
to read it, let alone accept it.  This became one
sign of internal trauma, of which more later.

<h2 id="rlo">  4. Risks, Liabilities and Obligations </h2>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <blockquote><b>DRC: R / L / O</b></blockquote>
  <ul><li>
    Subscribers -- same
    </li><li>
    DRC:  <i>Risks</i> of the parties.
    </li><li>
    DRC:  especially, the <i>end-user</i>.
    </li><li>
    Hard to avoid for &hArr; all parties
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
The major area where DRC departs from WebTrust is in the
issues of Risks and Liabilities.  Consider
these Criteria, briefly
<a href="http://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/Audit/AuditCriteriaOnRisksLiabilitiesObligations.html">here</a>,
and compare the DRC approach to the WebTrust approach.
</p>

<h4> DRC Risks and Liabilities are Spread out</h4>

<p>
Both require the listing of <i>Obligations</i>
and <i>Liabilities</i> of Subscribers
(for DRC, A.3.e, A.4.d, A.6.c, A.6.d, B.2.e, B.2.5.
For WebTrust, 4, 14).
</p>

<p>
There are subtle differences:
DRC requires the CA to state
the <i>Risks</i>
(being bad things that might happen)
of all parties (A.1.h, A.3.j, B.2.c),
and especially for the <i>end-user</i> (A.6.a).
Further, the CA has to state the <i>Liabilities</i> that it itself
is prepared to take on (A.6.b).
</p>

<p>
DRC requires that the risks and liabilities of all who
come into contact be stated, more or less.
The weight of criteria on these points
stress the emphasis in a way that it is hard for a CA to avoid;
end-users and the public have a right to see it clearly and
fairly, and the CA is forced to be open and thoughtful.
</p>

<h4> WebTrust pushes the Risks and Liabilities away from the CA </h4>
 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>WebTrust 4,5</b></center>

<i>
<ol>
  <li type="4"> Any applicable provisions regarding<br>apportionment of liability
  <li type="5"> Financial responsibility, including:
    <ul>
       <li> Indemnification by relying parties </li>
       <li> Fiduciary relationships </li>
    </li>
</ol>
</i>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
WebTrust on the other hand permits the CA to define
this quite loosely with its criteria 4,5.
</p>

<p>
With WebTrust, the Relying Party is expected to carry the load,
whereas DRC spreads the load across the three or four parties,
and insists that all the components be documented.
In comparison to DRC,
WebTrust's rather brutal
"indemnification by relying parties" seems to predict 
it is slanted towards ensuring
that the CA is protected from the users.
This may be a useful <i>commercial</i> objective,
but it seems decidedly odd for a systems audit,
and its utility to a vendor or end-user has
to be suspect.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>WebTrust on RPs</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    RPs indemnify the CA ?
    </li><li>
    closed provisions?
    </li><li>
    What we don't know can't help!
    </li><li>
    What we don't know can vary!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
What is left unstated, and is therefore unclear in WebTrust,
is just how these criteria
could be interpreted in an audit?
Do the said <i>apportionments</i>, above,
have to be notified?
Is it acceptable to bury the <i>indemnifications</i>
in fine print, or do they have to be advised
and accepted by the users?
As this is not stated anywhere, the clear incentive
is to not do any of it.
</p>

<h4> Just who or what is a Relying Party? </h4>
 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>stated target?</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    WebTrust:  relying parties
    </li><li>
    DRC:  end-user &amp; general public
    </li><li>
    definition?
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
To underscore this, we can examine the language used,
and we find a significant difference.
Following PKI convention,
WebTrust talks about the <i>relying party</i>
whereas DRC talks about the <i>end-user</i>
and <i>the general public</i>.
Approximately, these terms refer to people who are not
subscribers, rather,
those that are given a certificate in order to
start an encrypted protocol, check an identity, or
check a signature, etc.
</p>

<p>
This difference in terms is not just a minor issue,
it is a major shift in liability, as we will see.
<i>Relying party</i> is a term that has to be
defined, and effectively, we can define a <i>relying party</i>
to be any person we like.
Indeed, this is just to state PKI convention, and the
place to define the relying party is the CPS.
</p>

<p>
Whereas <i>end-user</i> is a term for which we
already have a widespread and broad definition
in the language.
The end-user is the user of general purpose software,
such as a browser user, without any special caveats.
A limiting definition to <i>end-user</i>
would stick out baldly and badly.
Further, although the
term <i>end-user</i> might be validly discussed in court,
there is no chance of re-defining who
<i>the general public</i> is, nor of arguing it.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Emphasis</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    DRC:  must state for end-user.
    </li><li>
    R/L/O + end-user == protect end-user
    </li><li>
    WebTrust:  cover Relying Party?
    </li><li>
    Indemnification + RP == protect CA
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
In DRC, the audit will hold the CA to stating the
situation for all end-users, a situation that is
obviously aligned with the interests of those users,
and the browser vendor.
In WebTrust, there is all encouragement
to ignore the end-user totally, and to limit the
liability to those who do chose to become relying
parties.
</p>

<h4> On the Sanity of Dumping of all Liability and Risk </h4>

<p>
What then goes on in practice?  The favourable path is as
expected:
CAs generally define the relying party to be those who have directly
entered into a user agreement with the CA.  That agreement
then expressely seeks to limit the liability
of the CA to zero, and to dump it all on the new relying
party
    <small>[<a href="#ref_3" name="back_3">3</a>]</small> 
    <small>[<a href="#ref_4" name="back_4">4</a>]</small>. 
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Effective Liability</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Industry standard:  liability to zero
    </li><li>
    Consider liability of $1
    </li><li>
    across class-action lawsuit (phishing)
    </li><li>
    Any $$$ is too much!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>

<p>
Outrageous, you might say, and this would be the popular
criticism!
Except, there is one slight issue with this easy cry,
and it is a killer issue drawn from simple logic:
</p>

<p>
If the liability of the CA to the end-user, or worse,
to the general public, is not contained,
then the liability may be incurred by the CA.
Multiplied over all end-users,
it is simply unbounded.
Consider, for example,
class-action suits for phishing.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>How Much Liability?</b></center>
  <table>
    <tr><td># of victims:</td><td>  3.4 million </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Average loss:</td><td>  $1000 </td></tr>

    <tr><td>Liability: </td><td>  <b><big>$ X00,000 </big></b> </td></tr>
  </table>
  </td></tr></table>

<!--

Average loss to phishing, direct dollar cost:  $1000
Market share of one popular browser:  20% or 150m users

Fudge factor for contributory liability:  10%

Guestimated damages to vendor:  3,400,000 * 1000 * 20% * 10% = $68,000,000
Guestimated damages to CA:  3,400,000 * 1000 * 0.03% * 10% = $100,000
-->

<p>
It is then essential to contain this liability in some way.
That is, we must have a number, and we must have some
risk figure so we can multiply these numbers out and
cover the costs.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, it turns out that
</p>

<blockquote><i>
Zero liability to the general public
is the only sane choice.
</i></blockquote>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Zero!</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Must contain liability.
    </li><li>
    $1 per victim is a lot
    </li><li>
    <i>ZERO</i> is only sane choice.
    </li><li>
    <small>( Maybe WebTrust was right? )</small>
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
By way of counter-example,
let's say you want to set the liability to $1
for each user.  According to some measures, this could
mean all who saw that certificate,
all users of Paypal,
or, all users of the Internet.
In a class action suit, this could mean a
buck for *everyone*  As there
are a billion of them out there, and they keep on growing,
this is not what we would call "bounded" in any rational
sense.
</p>

<p>
You want to offer less than a buck?
The only sensible number for liability is zero.
The way forward is, no matter how outrageous,
to disclaim all liability to the general public
and to use whatever legal and technical
defences are at hand to set the
<i>expected liability to zero</i>.
</p>

<h4> Netscape's Dilemma </h4>


<p>
Which then leaves us with a dilemma.  What good is the CA?
Who does it serve?
If a certificate gives no protection if it goes wrong,
what's the point?
If Bob gets phished, how much does the certificate
pay out?  Zero?
</p>
 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Value to?</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    What good is a CA?
    </li><li>
    Mozo: <small> <i>"benefits and risks ... to typical users"</i></small>
    </li><li>
    MS: <small><i>"benefits... outweigh any risks to customers."</i></small>
    </li><li>
    MS (2): <small><i>"alignment... with Microsoft strategies."</i></small>
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
What exactly does a certificate do for the end-user?
</p>

<p>
And, serious students of business will ask
why did Netscape foster the world with this
rather odd, asymmetric and legally-fraught arrangement?
Cynics will immediately spot the issue
here and say that the CA serves itself, and only itself.
(Gee, thanks Netscape!)
Well, if CAs manage to disclaim all the liability,
to all the people
then the cynics might have a good point.
Indeed, it may have been this very issue
that prompted Mozilla to add in the following clause to the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/policy/">
Mozilla CA policy</a>:

<p>
There are ways out of this dilemma for the CA.
</p>

<ul><li>
    Firstly, it is
    possible to create two groups of people:  those that you are
    liable to, and those that you are not.  As long as the first group
    gains value, and the second group is not disadvantaged,
    the benefit to the first group might meet standard of
    the above stakeholders.
  </li><li>
    Secondly, it is possible to deliver useful goods without accepting
    liability.
    For example, open source software is commonly delivered for
    zero price, and zero liability.
    Open source is still useful.
  </li><li>

    </li><li>
    Incorporate their needs.
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

    Thirdly, it is possible to disclose the real deal,
    up front, and let users decide.
    If they still go ahead, they must have found something of use.
  </li><li>
    Fourthly, it is reasonable to suggest that the end-user
    of the target browser is a valid stakeholder in the
    audit, and consider their needs.
</li></ul>

<br><br><br><br>

<h3> How CAcert springs from the horns of the Liability Dilemma </h3>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>CAcert's deal</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Open Disclosure of all to all!
    </li><li>
    Two separate groups.
    </li><li>
    Joining is free.
    </li><li>
    (User Agreement needed)
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
Remembering that DRC forces the open disclosure of
the full story, CAcert has to take the bull by the horns
    <small>[<a href="#ref_5" name="back_5">5</a>]</small>. 
CAcert chose these basic tactics:
</p>

<ul><li>
    Open disclosure of all to all.
  </li><li>
    Creation of two clearly separated groups.
  </li><li>
    Group 1:  <b>Outsiders</b>
     <ul><li>
         Disclaim all liability to outsiders,
       </li><li>
         but offer USE.
     </li></ul>
  </li><li>
 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Insiders</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Accept liability.
    </li><li>
    Permitted to RELY.
    </li><li>
    Members under
    <a href="http://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.php">CCA</a>
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
    Group 2: <b>Insiders</b>
     <ul><li>
         Accept liability to insiders
       </li><li>
         and offer RELIANCE.
     </li></ul>
  </li><li>
    Joining as an insider is free
    <ul><li>
         but bound to a user agreement,
       </li><li>
         (which did not exist, so needed to be written anyway).
    </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>
This seems to be a fair offer, although it is somewhat
different from what has been imagined.
Outsiders can use the certificates, just as is in
common with other CAs.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Outsiders</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Disclaim all liability
    </li><li>
    Permitted to USE.
    </li><li>
    <b>Not Permitted to RELY</b>
    </li><li>
    end-users or "Non-Related Persons"
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
The difference so far is two-fold:
Firstly, CAcert will go to the extent possible to
tell all users what the story is, and will also
attempt to push the appropriate story to others,
the non-related persons with whom by definition
CAcert has no relationship.
Tough challenge!
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Liability Deal</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    <b>&euro; 1000</b>
    </li><li>
    agreement says:  from Member
    </li><li>
    to whom?
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
Secondly,
instead of attempting to bind the
relying parties to a liability of zero, by means of
legal devices layered one after the other, CAcert
seeks to explicitly set some value in place.
As it happens, that value is serious:
</p>
<center> <b> <big> &euro;1000 </big> </b> </center><br>

<p>
which at the time of writing is around
<small>USD</small> $1446,
<small>GBP</small> &pound;790,
<small>MXN</small> $15265,
or <small>AUD</small> $1747.
</p>

<br><br>

<h4> How does CAcert allocate the unbounded liability? </h4>

<p>
This still leaves a problem.
If an insider can claim some value as damages,
we still have the same old problem of
unbounded liability.  Above, we said that any value
multiplied by an unbounded user base was unacceptable.
As CAcert has unbounded admittability in users,
this is potentially the same issue.
</p>

<!-- XXX need to describe here the past situation of there being no definition of members before ... so something was needed anyway. -->

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>

  <center><b>Liability Allocation</b></center>
  <ul><li>

    </li><li>
      "Alternate Dispute Resolution"
    </li><li>
    own forum, jurisdiction, Arbitrators
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
In order to avoid the trap of unbounded liability,
CAcert simply allocates the liability back to the
users.  And this "judo trick" is where the user
agreement really starts to show its differences.
</p>

<p>
Users are not promised coverage of &euro;1000 as implied above.
In fact it is entirely the reverse:  Users are told that
they themselves are liable for that amount.
Indeed, by entering into the user agreement,
the users are <i> worsening their apparent
liability position from
an assumed zero to an amount of &euro;1000</i>.
</p>

<p>
In order to accept this, users would presumably have to
value the certificates.
But what is far more important is how this liability is
passed through from one user to another.
</p>

<h4> Arbitration reverts All to the Users </h4>
<p>
As with judo, such legal pass-throughs need rules.
In order to transfer the liability in a bounded
manner between the Members,
CAcert establishes <i>its own jurisdiction in law</i>,
and binds all users into that jurisdiction.
</p>

<p>
The technical, legal way of doing this is by
by means of <i>Arbitration</i>, which is sometimes
referred to as a form of <i>Alternate Dispute Resolution</i>
or ADR.
CAcert's forum is discussed in a later section.



<h4> Summing Up Before the Court of CAcert </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Members</b></center>
  <ul><li>

    </li><li>
    Members resolve their disputes themselves
    </li><li>
    And can RELY!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
In summary,
CAcert creates two groups of people, being the Members,
and the Non-Related Persons.
Where the paths separate for
the two classes of people
is in the user agreement that
either class is faced with.
If you as a user have agreed to the
<a href="ihttp://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.php">
CAcert Community Agreement</a> ("CCA"),
you are on the "inside",
you are a Member,
and you can take your grievances to the forum of
Arbitration.
If you have not agreed,
you are on the outside,
and any liability is disclaimed.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>End-Users - what about them?</b></center>

  </td></tr></table>

<p>
Those users who have agreed to the CCA are referred to as Members,
and are permitted to RELY on the certificates,
which means they can make a financial or otherwise risky
decision that requires and is effected by
the information in the certificates.
If it goes wrong, if for some reason their
reliance does not work out,
they can sue for damages in Arbitration.
In counterpoint,
these selfsame insiders are made liable for their own
actions, and liability to them is accepted by the CA itself.

<p>
The second group are offered a licence to USE
the certificates.  Much like an open source licence,
the users of browsers are permitted to use the certificates
as they are presented by their software, or by a CAcert
Member at the other end of the protocol.
What they are not permitted to do is RELY,
which means they cannot make a financial or otherwise risky
decision that requires the information in the certificate.
The disclaimer of liability is simply the flip side of
there being no permission to RELY.

<h4> Wheretofore the CA? </h4>

<p>
Where is CAcert Inc., the legal entity, in all this?
The Board?  The systems administrators?

<p>
According to Policy on Policy, all policies are binding
on all Members and that includes the CA itself.
The rules of Arbitration are such a duly approved policy,
so CAcert Inc., may appear before the Arbitrator with the same
standing as any other Member.
</p>

<p>
As all volunteers to CAcert are Members, including the Board,
the Systems Administrators, and other roles, all parties are
before the Arbitrator, equally.  Indeed, within a day or so
of the policy being approved, the Auditor
as Member was called to Arbitration
    <small>[<a href="#ref_6" name="back_6">6</a>]</small>:

<p>
There are no exceptions within CAcert to these rules,
and as the concept of Arbitration is uniformly
promulgated throughout the CA, this
travels some substantial distance towards meeting the
spirit of DRC:  <i>be fair to all</i>.
</p>


<h4> The infinite utility of unbounded USE? </h4>

<p>
What then means <i>USE</i>?
According to the various policies, it is that which
your software does for you,
and that which you never do for yourself.
</p>
  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>USE?</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    what your software does
    </li><li>
    email, SSL, etc
    </li><li>
    Encryption
    </li><li>
    Do other checks...
    </li><li>
    Not for big ecommerce
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>

<p>
The general public come into contact with certificates
in approximately these ways:  email, and encrypted
SSL webservers.
USE works very well for encryption of email,
because we simply want to turn on the crypto,
and not ask who our counterparty is
(us users already know who we are talking to,
even if the PKI Industry persists in telling us that we do not).
USE also works well for encryption of
web server traffic.
</p>


<p>
However there is one exception:
USE falls somewhat short when ecommerce may be involved
with non-related persons.
This is because ecommerce may involve
a RELIANCE by that non-related person,
e.g., the act of putting a credit card into
an encrypted website.
Partly for this reason, CAcert does not recommend ecommerce
in its CPS, preferring to indicate to Subscribers that,
as NRPs are not allowed to rely,
exposing credit cards may complicate
the position for the Subscriber.
</p>

<p>
This <i>offer to USE</i> is delivered in
licence agreement best thought of as the
agreement that comes with your open source:
you probably do not notice it,
but nothing else gives you permission to USE.
In that offer, there is also a ban on you
RELYING on the certificates, and some other
administrative limits.
</p>

<h4> Members are RELYING parties! </h4>
<p>
And now we see the final expression of PKI:
the Members who have agreed to the CCA are
the relying parties.  In contract form,
CAcert is little different from any other CA,
however what that contract agreement states
is very different.
</p>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>RELY?</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    decision you make as Member
    </li><li>
    Info in certificate
    </li><li>
    disputes &rArr; Arbitrator
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>

<br>
<p>
RELIANCE is then defined to be any decision
that you the Member (!) makes on your own.
Explicitly, it is not that which your software
does for you.
</p>

<br>
<p>
<b>Actual Value in Liability.</b>
Members are explicitly given a liability limit of &euro;1000.
They can present their case,
and conceivably get an award of damages, although
it is entirely up to the Arbitrator to rule on how much
to compensate each party, and from where this value
is derived.
It also means that claimants and respondents themselves
are the community, and the balance of fairness for them
and everyone else must be sought.
What is unusual is that for the first time in CA history,
a large group of users have a clear
ability to go and get satisfaction.

<h4> The Steps in Policy and Documents </h4>

  </slide>  </td></tr></table>

<p>
This great edifice is constructed of three key policies
which, if laid end-to-end, would probably be shorter than
the above entire description.
</p>

<ol><li>
     <a href="http://www.cacert.org/policy/NRPDisclaimerAndLicence.php">
     Non-related persons -- Disclaimer and Licence</a>
     ("NRP-DAL")
     gives permission to casual end-users and the general
     public to USE certificates, but not RELY on them.
     This is the analogue to an open source licence such
     as the GPL.  Yes, you can use the "software", but only
     in ways that we say, and don't come crying to us afterwards.
   
   </li><li>
     The
     <a href="http://www.cacert.org/policy/CAcertCommunityAgreement.php">
     CAcert Community Agreement</a>
     ("CCA") gives
     permission to USE and to RELY.  But it also binds
     the Member into Arbitration by means of
     a special clause.


   </li><li>
     Finally, the
     <a href="ihttp://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/dispute_resolution.html">
     Rules of Dispute Resolution</a>
     are the procedures that guide the Arbitrator through
     any given dispute.
</ol>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
<center><b>x. We do not act to the detriment of NRPs</b></center>
<small>
<p>You may be asked to help NRPs in security. It is your choice to do so, but if you do, you should not act to their detriment. You should encourage NRPs to join the community.</p>
<p>While we work for the benefit of our own users, we must balance our benefit against harm to others. Achieving a benefit to ourselves at the expense of others has no part in our principles.</p>
<p>Other users may join, and they become of us. We exist to help the security of our community, but we also exist to help the security of everyone.</p>
</small>
<p align="center" color="grey"><i>svn.cacert.org/CAcert/principles.html</i></p>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
In addition, 
a sister document called the
     <a href="http://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/principles.html">
     Principles of the CAcert Community</a>
     documents various practices.  These are those things
     CACert Members might desire,
     but find difficult to turn into a hard rule.
     For example, the Principles includes a clause
     that says <i>"We do not act to the detriment of NRPs."</i>
<p>


<p>
     Rather than defining such a thing, it is up to an Arbitrator
     to look at whether this principle is breached.
</p>

<h3> The Result:  A fair deal, and a valuable one! </h4>

<p>
For perhaps the first time in certificate history, CAcert
is now offering all its own users a good deal.  They can
USE and RELY, and if something goes wrong, they have
recourse.
Further, that has been done without harming the interests
of the wider public, unduly.  In exchange for the confusion
of the past, the general public has clear permission to USE.
And, although they cannot RELY,
they are permitted to file cases,
and can always join as a Member, for free.
</p>
 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Fair</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    RELIANCE means something
    </li><li>
    end-users are not disadvantaged
    </li><li>
    doco + resolution
    </li><li>
    Free and open.
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
Much remains to be done.  But what has been done has
acheived something that is implausible under WebTrust:
a good deal for the users.  Further, the strength of
the basic mechanism means that as a group, security
can be the aim, and cash flow can be subordinated to
that aim.
</p>


<h2 id="mgmt">  5. The Management Story </h2>

<h3>  History </h3>

<p>
In around 2004, the business of CAcert was transferred
fully into an Association of Members, registered in NSW,
Australia.  Included were minuted agreements
to transfer the domain names, servers and source code
from the founder, Duane Groth, to the Association.
A board was duly elected.

<p>
These steps created the foundation
for CAcert as an independent and professional business.
However, a foundation only:  the house was yet to be
built.
</p>

<h4>  The collapse of the 2004 Board </h4>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>2004 Board</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Association and Board of 2004
    </li><li>
    very quiet in 2006
    </li><li>
    Decision:
    <small><i>"dislaim liability to general public!"<br>"Or else!"</i></small>
    </li><li>
    Confusion...
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>

<p>
Above, we touched on the topic of submitting policies
to the Board for approval.  As well as the lack of
progress in policies, there were other issues:
lack of feedback on any questions,
lack of any minutes or published decisions,
apparently years behind on financial reports and AGMs,
lack of response to requests for costs.
</p>

<p>
A critical test was reached around mid-2006 when I
insisted that the Board approve
<i>the disclaiming of all liability to the general public,</i>
"or else."
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, in the panic to avoid unstated sanctions,
the Board voted on a garbled proposal forced on them by
non-Board members.
The result, or whatever could
be determined from the email conversations, could be
read any way we liked.  Literally, it appeared to
accept the feared termination of the Audit, rather
than their apparent intention to agree with the demands.
</p>

<p>
In effect, the Board had proven they would simply
decline to approve anything, unless nailed over a barrel
with roughly-cut splinters, and slowly lowered over
shark-infested waters with burning tapers between their toes.
Even then, the members would conveniently fail
to recall what it was they were asked of,
and would yell out agreement in piratical harmony
to anything at all:
"We agree!  Have mercy!"
</p>

<p>
This left CAcert in the position of grave uncertainty:
I had secured some sort of agreement but was
unable to work out what the agreement was.
I checked with four different Board members
and none were able to describe
what it was they had agreed to.
In detail, I was left with no choice but to
proceed with my own directive on the issue at hand.
In the wider picture, there was now sufficient evidence
that the Board was dysfunctional, and something had to
be done.
</p>

<h4>  Increasing the pressure </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>The Auditor's Dilemma</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    2006: 
    Board did not approve Policies
    </li><li>
    But Audit does not cover Board.
    </li><li>
    <blockquote><small><i>"Management has put in place<br>policies and procedures..."</i></small></blockquote>
    </li><li>
    Pressure Point
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
It was clear by mid-2006 that CAcert has led by a team that
had failed to grow with the organisation.
The big question was, what to do about it, and what
part does this play in the Audit?
</p>


<p>
There is no criteria that says
<blockquote><i>
"management must be competent to consider,
agree and approve policies wisely,"
</i></blockquote>
Likewise, the USA auditing profession's <i>Attest Standard</i>
suggests, not to take on an engagement that cannot be completed,
but says little on what happens if one is already engaged.
Not so helpful!
</p>

<p>
However, in the Audit Opinion, being the ultimate work
product of the audit, there is phraseology that starts:

<blockquote><i>
Management has put in place policies and procedures....
</i></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
This gave me the way out of the dilemma.  If the
management cannot meet this standard, then the Audit
cannot conclude.
As there was a provable lack of new policies and procedures,
it could be asserted that there was no Management.
The process of raising the pressure to change the situation
then became one of repeating this claim on the mail lists and in other
forums of importance.
No management, no audit.  Logical, reasonable, and while
novel, it was sufficient to raise the red flag.
</p>

<p>
What was less clear to those who cared
was what to do about the dramatic claims I made.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>2006 Failure of Board</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    "no management."
    </li><li>
    Resignations.
    </li><li>
    Loss of quorum &rArr; frozen
    </li><li>
    Special General Meeting
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
And, publically, there were no suggestions offerred.
An Auditor is not engaged to review the Board, but the CA.
Only within the context of the CA and its audit
can any strong opinion be made.
More particularly, although it might be possible
to suggest the Board is not up to the job of
managing the CA, it is a very
different thing to suggest
what it is that the Board should do about the situation.
</p>

<p>
Hence, the opinion was couched in terms of
"no management," which might have been interpreted
as a request to the Board to appoint a manager.
Of course, the Board did no such thing as the real and
underlying issue was not the absence of managers but the
absence of the Board.
In time, the absence of all meaningful management
activity reached even the slowest
and darkest corners of the collective consciousness,
and, one by one,
the directors resigned.
</p>

<p>
With the apparent reduction of active directors below 3,
around March 2007,
the Board entered a state wherein it could no longer
form a legal quorum, and therefore could make no decision.
The Board was completely frozen, and the onus now
shifted to the Association to unfreeze
their Board.
The members rallied together, called for a Special
General Meeting, and voted in a new Board on
25th May 2007.
</p>

<h4>  The Founder Paradox </h3>

<blockquote><i>
Success is a lousy teacher.
It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.
</i><br>
<small> Bill Gates </small>
</blockquote>


<p>
The root of the issues with CAcert during the years 2004
to 2006 is what is known as
the <i>Founder Paradox</i>.  In brief, one person
has a bright idea, makes it happen, and becomes the
master of all he surveys.  In time, the business grows
to the extent that it outgrows the ability of that
original founder to see all the aspects.
At this point, a team is required;  but it does not
get put in place because the original founder
believes, more or less, that because he got it to
where it is now, he knows more than any team.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Founder Paradox</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    expert in everything surveyed
    </li><li>

    </li><li>
    Association created in 2004
    </li><li>
    formation of new Board
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
Students of business know this from their b-school
cases on family firms.
What is not known is how to deal with it, as there
is no good strategy, no 5-points HBR summary to
solve the founder problem.  It takes years,
it's always painful, and many companies fail.
Above, in CAcert's case, the answer derived from
the earlier 2004 decision to place the intellectual
property and the community in the hands of a formal
Association, and to elect a proper Board.  As this
Board failed in due course, and confidence wavered,
the Association was still there and was able to
rally together to save the day
    <small>[<a href="#ref_7" name="back_7">7</a>]</small>. 

<p>
What is also left as the founder's legacy is
that once he or she moves aside
(as he or she or the business must, in the end),
there is a vacuum.  This is the founder's legacy.
CAcert was no exception to that, and suffered from
a predictable and widespread trauma in building up a team and
structure to make the organisation work in the aftermath
of the loss of its one most productive member.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, CAcert was an open and popular organisation, and
things happened to guide it.
</p>


<h3> Governance </h3>

<h4> The Evolving Crisis </h4>

<p>
As 2006 drew to a close, and as the directors were
resigning, matters came to a head in many areas.
Action was called for, care was needed.
Unfortunately, several issues came up which indicated that
the organisation was in more trouble than expected.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, the servers.
As CAcert operated nominally for free, it had no
budget to speak of for server costs.  Which meant
that the servers were colocated at a "friendly business."
Now, it needs no great experience to predict what happens
in that case, and the business turned unfriendly in due course.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Crisis?  What Crisis?</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    2. "friendly hoster" turned unfriendly
    </li><li>
    <small>(NLnet suggested Netherlands)</small>
    </li><li>
    3. Audit took time
    </li><li>
    <small>(Other CAs suggested subroots ...)</small>
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
    The movement of the servers out of their current
    location then became critical.  Joyfully, a very
    attractive deal was offered by NLnet, a long-term
    funder of good works, to finance and manage a
    rack's worth of equipment in a secure center.
</p>

<p>
    This deal was wonderful, economically, yet complex,
    legally, and governance-wise.
    Setting it up took time and attention,
    and what was perhaps more important, skill.
    Pressure mounted to secure a deal, and it became
    fraught. The pressure of time
    clashed with the needs to secure the operations
    and maintain a long-term strategy beneficial to the
    users, and CAcert found itself being pushed into a
    deal that wasn't good for it.
</p>

<p>
Secondly,
    as Mozilla was still "the prize" in many
    people's minds, and the audit was apparently
    taking time, alternatives were looked at.
    The basic concept was to subordinate the CA's
    root to the roots of other CAs already "in".
    Via subroots, CAcert certificates would then be
    represented within the browsers, but for all
    sorts of business reasons not covered here,
    the users would also eventually transfer to the new CAs.
    In short, this is no different to any other
    insider sellout, except with the possible absence
    of the customary under-the-table payoff.
</p>

<p>
The first of these efforts to merge with another CA
was a fairly obvious ploy that was spotted by the Founder.
The second however was not, and discussions had
advanced to what appeared to be a verbal agreement
around a draft Memorandum of Understanding.
</p>

<h4> Oversight by the Auditor </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Audit takes Control</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    no experienced manager
    </li><li>
    Need to protect users and directors
    </li><li>
    Asserted control December 2006
    </li><li>
    Serious signal!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
No experienced manager was in place who could
deal with contracts and commitments.
When too many of these exceptional cases occurred,
I decided in December 2006 to assert direct oversight.
</p>

<p>
This act was not done lightly.
If this were a financial audit, this would be a
signal akin to bankrupcy or other failure, and
within Australian rules, I would be required to
report this event to the financial regulators.
The severity of oversight needs to be seen in that context.
</p>

<p>
Not only was there an impact on the CA,
but also the allocation of liability became difficult
to control.
Potentially, anyone could
then blame the auditor for any misfortune that followed.
No matter the rightness or fairness of any such claim,
there would be distractions, challenges to independence,
and even suits and costs.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there were in the order of 100,000
users to consider, and the wellbeing
of the directors and other people on the inside.
The actions were creating potential liabilities for the
directors who remained at the time, and they were clearly
not capable of understanding or handling these
responsibilities.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Suspension of Audit</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Frozen December 2006.
      <ul><li>
          Absence of managers
        </li><li>

        </li><li>
          Also, loss of independence.
      </li></ul>
    </li><li>
    No deals!  <small>(Except NLnet)</small>
    </li><li>
    Not to enter root lists.
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
After some thought, I decided to take the following steps:
</p>

<ol><li>
    The audit was henceforth frozen.
  </li><li>
    Auditor takes direct oversight over all "deals" with
    other parties.
    In general, all deals were "off", excepting those that
    I personally supervised.  This essentially reduced to
    the Netherlands Data Center agreement with what was
    to become Oophaga Foundation.
  </li><li>
    CAcert was to no longer seek to enter any root lists,
    and was not to engage in discussions over this issue.
    At a later time, I wrote on Mozilla's bugzilla that
    express situation and asked them to withdraw the
    request.  Mozilla complied :)
  </li><li>
    This was quoted for two motives:
    <ol type="i"><li>
        Absence of management, as signalled over the
        preceeding 6 months.
      </li><li>
        The event of moving the servers from
        Australia to Netherlands via Vienna would 
        probably break audit requirements severely.
        Pragmatically, however, the need to maintain
        and move
        the servers in their unaudited (and possibly
        unauditable) state overrode the needs for the audit.
    </li></ol>
    Motives that were not quoted however included
    the potential for loss of audit independence.
</li></ol>

<p>
This was done by
signalling in maillists the above points,
as and when I felt necessary.
This effectively placed the CA <i>under administration</i>
until the creation and bedding-in of the new Board.
This situation was kept up even after the new Board,
as there was no guarantee at that time that the
new Board would be able to pick up the pieces.
</p>

<h4>  The Advisory </h3>

<p>
The old "core team had already taken some steps
to put in place more structure.
This initiative had two components in a matrix form:
a horizontal "products" arrangement, and a
vertical "department" arrangement.
Over the period of 2006, some people had been slotted
into this with only limited success, for the usual
reasons:
Granting a title to someone does not a manager make.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>New Management</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Attempt at new "Officers"
    </li><li>
    Two other managers turned up.
    </li><li>
    One on the NLnet deal
    </li><li>
    Other on Education &amp; Orgs.
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
The second attempt was far more successful.
As we crossed into 2007,
two other interested people started to put increasing
amounts of time into the project
(I have chosen not to name names in this document,
but for sake of clarification, these are TH and JP).
One was able to secure funding for the creation
of the new data center, and the other agreed to take
on the education responsibilities that had been created
due to the audit.
</p>

<p>
What became apparent over the months of the crisis
was that these two very experienced people,
along with myself, had the experience to make this happen.
However, we all had a very big issue:  none of us could
take on any formal decision-making role or take on any
responsibility in the management of CAcert.
All for different reasons, it seems,
but the result was the same:  no responsibility nor
any decision could be made.
</p>

<h4> The Grey Hairs are there for a reason </h4>

  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
To solve this dilemma, we took a leaf out of the
European book of corporate governance, and created
an <i>Advisory</i> that had no powers, no say, no
responsibilities and no tasks.  In essence, we
just gave ourselves a title.  And started saying
things.
</p>

<p>
In a vacuum,
grey hairs generate less friction,
less entropy and less lateral temptation.
In effect, although we made
no decisions, our words, our careful questions,
and our complete examples of policies rode above
the storm of white-noise
normally experienced
by such organisations collapsing into chaos.
</p>

<p>
Along the line of "this is what you could do,"
CAcert then proceeded to sort itself out:
</p>

<ul><li>
    Advisory stage-managed the
    Special General Meeting to elect a new Board.
    Members of the Association were nagged to be present,
    plans and timelines were laid out to regimental precision,
    new Directors was canvassed and chosen before the event,
    and motions were carefully written to give
    a new team a fighting chance of taking control.
    The entire event was a scripted affair,
    leaving nothing to chance.
  </li><li>
    Fortune smiled,
    and a new Board was elected on 25th May 2007 with the express
    mandate to "take control."
    Not however without her little jokes;
    as the election forgot to state who the new Directors were!
  </li><li>
 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>"This is what you could do..."</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    SGM &rArr; new Board

    core team &rArr; <small>Officers, Board, sys team</small>
    </li><li>
    flew Board to Europe for a week
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
    In parallel,
    Advisory proceeded to fill out the above-mentioned
    Officers Structure with keen
    Assurers, as available, mostly drafted from events.
    In this way CAcert was joined by Officers in the
    Events, Press relations, Documentation,
    and other departments.
    We disposed of the "products" area, so the
    structure reverted to a more classical vertical
    line.
    Advisory still retained the Human Resources department
    to itself, for the obvious reasons.
  </li><li>
    Advisory carefully and deliberately
    managed the transition from the old
    concept of "core team does everything" to
    "officers do their areas, and the Board does the rest...."
    This essentially meant the wholesale transfer of
    power from a small "inside" core team, a legacy of the
    Founder's time, to a wider group made up of Officers,
    Board and Advisory.
  </li><li>
    In the post-SGM honeymoon period, it became apparent
    there was simply too much to do.
    Advisory crafted, drafted, funded and accomodated
    a plan to fly the three new
    Directors to Europe and lock them in a room for a
    week.  From concept to meeting was only two months,
    including the slow European August, no mean feat for
    an organisation in chaos.
</li></ul>

<p>
    It is fair to say that in the vacuum of the
    frozen Board, Advisory rode these issues fairly hard.
    Advisory continued to pick up a lot of areas while
    the Board was finding its feet.
    As the Board ramped up in its capabilities,
    the Advisory gradually faded into the background.
    By the time of the full AGM of November 2007,
    Advisory was no longer active in its previous form,
    and was replaced by a formal management
    sub-committee designated by the Board.
</p>

<h4> Handover </h4>

<p>
The election of a new Board then presented an opportunity to
unwind the drastic step of control by Audit.
However it was not without doubt;
what would happen if this Board failed?
Would they even understand the issues of handover?
Should all things be unwound or should only some things be re-started?
What of the liability for proper decisions?
</p>

<p>
In the end, I delayed.  The Board moved slowly, and did not
in the first few months look at anything big or critical
outside their limited domain of meetings and procedures.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Handover</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    As board found their feet...
    </li><li>
    Advisory faded away.
    </li><li>
    Board declared itself "up to speed."
    </li><li>
    Audit gave up control!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
However, the decision to meet in September, 5 months after
the SGM, put the finger on this issue.
Hence, this document was first started as a briefing paper for
presentation to the Board at the September meeting,
and included a delicately placed question as to whether the
Board was ready to ask the Auditor to stand down.
</p>

<p>
The predictable resulted:  barely suppressed outrage,
much muttering, and "damn your eyes, sir!"
Which easily cleared the way for an informal suggestion
for a formal decision from the Board to assert that it
was "up to speed."  And, the Auditor was to revert to more
conventional duties.  This established a firm date as to
when any liability, etc., be capped, and terminated the affair.
An unfortunate and difficult period for all involved with CAcert
was now over.
</p>

<h4> And, finally, some Policies! </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>'Top'</b></center>

    Creation of Community:  CCA
    </li><li>
    Dispute Resolution Policy &rArr; Arbitration
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
In a 3 day session, the new Board read through
several policies, <i>line by line</i>, and approved them all.
</p>

<ul> <li>
     <u>Policy on Policy</u>,
     which pushed the job away
     from the Board and over to an "IETF-style" open group.
  </li><li>
     <u>Organisation Assurance Policy</u>,
     which created the groundwork for verifying organisations.
  </li><li>
     <u>CAcert Community Agreement</u>,
     the agreement for <i>all of us</i>,
     with the big scary liability number.
  </li><li>
     <u>Non-Related Persons - Disclaimer and Licence</u>,
     the <i>fair but free</i> offer to everyone else.
  </li><li>
     <u>Dispute Resolution Policy</u>,
     to deal with what goes wrong.
</li></ul>

<p>
With this massive injection we were back on track,
and the documentation requirements for audit were
now around 50% complete.
</p>

<p>
The executive meeting was one of the highlights of the
CAcert experience.
In a few days, a room full of professional managers
cleared through pretty much the entire backlog.
I consider this to be to be a testament to these factors:
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>A Highlight!</b></center>
  <ul><li>
      experience &amp; professionals.

      Time!  Space!  No phones!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>



<h3> Missions, Goals, and other B-Speak </h3>

<p>
Many of the issues that CAcert stumbled over,
during the audit and other forces, were
traceable back to that old saw:
the lack of a good mission.
For students of business, this section will be familiar,
and might be skipped.
</p>

<p>
To be fair, CAcert was not so far off in this
department.  Two "primary goals" are boasted on the
<a href="http://www.cacert.org/">website</a>.
</p>

<ol><li>
  Inclusion into mainstream browsers!
</li><li>
  To provide a trust mechanism to go with
  the security aspects of encryption.
</li></ol>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Mission</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Into the browsers?
    </li><li>
    Run a CA?
    </li><li>
    Deliver certs for free?
    </li><li>
    Secure the World?
    </li><li>
    Help the Members to Secure themselves?
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
<p>
Goals here are things that we are doing
that are important to us, they are
significant, and they have a beginning
and an end.  Both above goals qualify.
</p>

<p>
The problem then is one of completion.
What happens when the browsers include
CAcert?  Do we sit back and congratulate
ourselves on a good job?
What happens after apocalypse,
and the software vendors start distributing
opportunistic keys, wherein no CA need apply?
</p>

<p>
What happens is what the mission says;
this is the one thing that defines us,
the one thing that we do, and always do.
With it, we are who we are, and successful,
without it we are failure, we have no other names.
</p>

<p>
So when the CA job is done, we go back to
the mission, and ask "what next?"
When a topic comes along that doesn't
exactly speak of the CA role, we go to the
mission and ask it for its wisdom.
</p>

<h4> What Missions have been suggested </h4>

<ol><li>
    Deliver certs for free.
  </li><li>
    Run a Certification Authority.
    Get into the browsers.
  </li><li>
    Secure the users.
    Secure the world.
  </li><li>
   to secure its members access to the net...
   to provide security services to members...
   to facilitate the security and privacy of members... 
  </li><li>
    to promote awareness and education
    on computer security through the use of encryption,
    specifically with the X.509 family of standards. 
  </li><li>
    Help the Users to secure themselves.
</li></ol>

<p>
Of the above, the first two are really goals,
and the first drives the second.
The third makes CAcert too responsible, and
falters on the fairly vague definition of
security.
</p>

<p>
The last is my favourite. Let's take it for
a test drive.
</p>

<table border="1" cellgap="5">
 <tr>
  <th>
    Question?

  <th> Answer == Mission </th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
    Why is CAcert running a CA?
  </td>
  <td> Because ... </td>

<table>

<p>
Now answer the question with each of the above missions:
</p>

<blockquote><b>
"Because it helps the Users to secure themselves."
</b></blockquote>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Why a Mission?</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Mission answers questions
    </li><li>
    Do we do X?  Yes if the mission says so.
    </li><li>
    a <i>work-in-progress</i>
    </li><li>
    post-Audit
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
<p>
If it sounds good for all the difficult
questions we can find, then we may have
a winner.  If not, more thought needed;
and try substituting another mission.
</p>

<center><i><b> work in progress ...  </b></i></center>

<h4> Where the Mission will help </h4>

<p>
The mission helps to define things that
should be done, and as importantly not
done.
</p>

<p>
As the mission is neutral, it helps to
resolve opposing camps, and to keep people
honest.  If they can show their proposals
lead logically to the mission, without
challenge or undue cost, then the proposals
are strong, and the people proposing are
less important.
</p>

<p>
It also sets the future.  As CAcert moves
into a mature CA rollout, it can take pause
and think what the mission suggests should
be done next.

  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<h3> Identity and Certs </h3>

<h4> The (very) basic idea of Certificates </h4>
<p>
The basic idea of certificates is that it shows
your identity to people.
The theory is that if your identity is good,
you can do some trade or communication with
others who also have good identity.
The certificate will communicate that good
identity, and will also let
you use some crypto to further secure your
trade or communication.
This could either be encryption of your
traffic, or making some claim about another
document ("I'm selling my house!")
or yourself ("Hi Mom, it's me!").
</p>
<p>
Then, as a basic expectation, all Certification
Authorities should:
 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>To do Identity</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Check identity
    </li><li>
    Sign that identity
    </li><li>
    Not sign to someone else.
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<ul> <li>
       Check your identity carefully
    </li> <li>
       Sign your key with your identity.  Carefully,
    </li> <li>
       Not sign your identity to someone else's key?!?!?
</li> </ul>
</p>

<p>
Clearly, this (very) basic idea depends heavily on
something called Identity.
</p>

<h4> The PGP idea:  Web of Trust </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Web-of-trust</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Everyone can make a statement
    </li><li>
    assumption:  I know more than you
    </li><li>
    assumption:  we know more than one person
    </li><li>
    limited by assumptions!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
In order to manage your Identity, CAcert adopted the
<i>web-of-trust</i> model ("WoT"), as pioneered by the PGP community.
In a <i>web-of-trust</i>,
each of us can state what we know of a person,
and sign that information so others can reliably get at it.
The underlying notion is that we the people
have a better grasp of who we are, and a capture
of the distributed links of relationship will tell
us what is useful to know better than a
centralised service can deliver the information.
</p>

<p>
As an old PGP hacker myself, I have little trouble
with the concept, but the details matter
    <small>[<a href="#ref_8" name="back_8">8</a>]</small>. 
Specifically, the PGP <i>web-of-trust</i> was fine as long
as nobody relied upon it.
And, even then, as long as each
individual understood that the information was raw opinion
from others like themselves, and the
reliance was on an <i>as is</i> basis, it worked.
Of course, these claims apply to most every design,
including the competing notions of PKI.
</p>


 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>CAcert's WoT</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Only Assurers make statements
    </li><li>
    Name statement: 2 checks, 50 points
    </li><li>
    Assurer: 3 checks, 100 points
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<h4> The CAcert Network of Assurers </h4>
<p>
CAcert adopted its WoT further by limiting the statements
of people's Identity to people they call <i>Assurers</i>.
This was possibly adopted from Thawte's "notary" model.
Each Assurer can give up to 35 points, and as you need
50 points to get a Named certificate, this implies
checks by two independent people.
The Assurers were defined as people with 100 points,
thus implying that they were vetted by at least 3 other Assurers.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Assurers</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    10,000 Assurers,
    100,000 Members
    </li><li>
    Face-to-face
    </li><li>
    Govt. issue Photo ID
    </li><li>
    Exceptions:  TTP
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
CAcert's Assurance network consisted of around
10,000 people, checking over a base of some 100,000 people.
At its simplest level, the Assurance process is a careful
human face-to-face verification of
government-issued photo-Identity documents.
</p>

<!-- <center><i>raise your hand if you are an Assurer</i></center> -->

<h4> The PKI Idea:  the Registration Authority </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>PKI's Registration Authority</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    assumption:  there must be an authority
    </li><li>
    assumption:  the authority is singular
    </li><li>
    limited by assumptions!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
In contrast to the above notions, the PKI idea was
grounded firmly in an authority for every important
act.  This is mostly traceable back to the
golden age of telecommunications whereby national champions
had a licence from a government, generally one only per country,
to control the communications of a country.
In that world, it was an article of faith
that the answer to any question could be found in the
designation, or creation, of an authority.
Preferably a single, national one, but always one with gravity.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Difference?</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    PGP Anarchy &rArr; Assurers
    </li><li>
    PKI Autocracy &rArr; RAs
    </li><li>
    Diff #1:  Numbers?
    </li><li>
    Diff #2:  Standards?
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
In the PKI literature, a single <i>Registration Authority</i>
is generally required to verify the user's Identity and
vouch that to the CA.
From a helicopter view, we can see that the differences are
much smaller than talked about.
From the anarchy of <i>web-of-trust</i>, CAcert reduced
the statements to a few thousand Assurers, requiring two
of these to agree.
From the superficial authoritarianism of the <i>Registration Authority</i>
model,
recent commercial models pushed the function out to thousands
of external companies, and recent audit designs now require the
process to be conducted by two or
more individuals within an organisation.
In this way, the differences between CAcert's system and
the PKI model are really at the detailed levels of quality,
and not at any fundamental level of design and structure.
</p>

<h4> Flaws with the Assurance Process </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Auditing thoughts...</b></center>
  <ol><li>
    what is the <i>standard?</i>
    </li><li>
    how is it <i>Checked?</i>
    </li><li>
    why is it <i>useful?</i>
  </li></ol>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
In the event, DG put in place a relatively good
system, so only minor tweaking was needed.
We can attack this concept at three levels,
being <i>what</i>, <i>how</i> and <i>why</i>.
</p>

<p>
First the standard.  It seems to be clear that
the standard of your Identity is critically dependent
on the documents that attest to your Identity.
In this context,
CAcert had more or less decided to go for
government-issued, photo identity docuemnts
by the time this audit had started.
While this standard has many, deep, political, philosophical
and geographical issues,
<i>it doesn't really get any better.</i>
To cut short a long story, this standard was accepted
without change.
</p>

<p>
Second, how is it checked?
CAcert had already decided to check the identity of
the users with the users themselves, as decided above.
As described, at least two Assurers would check the
identity before it could be put in your certificate,
and three at least were required before you could
also check others' identity.
</p>

<h3> Who Assures the Assurers? </h3>

<blockquote><i>
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?
</i><br>
<small> Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis, a.k.a. Juvenal </small>
</blockquote>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Checking</b></center>

    </li><li>
    Who Assures the Assurers?
    </li><li>
    Can I attack it?
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
Which led to a several problems.
<ul><li>
    At a simplistic level, how do we know
    who the Assurer was?
  </li><li>
    Or, in the extreme, who was
    <i>the very first Assurer</i>?
    Who was the second?
  </li><li>
    At a fairly simplistic level, how 
    do we know that anyone is checking?
  </li><li>
    At a more sophisticated level of quality, how do we
    know that the check that is done is good?
  </li><li>
    At the highly sophisticated level of Internet security
    in the world we now live in, what is to stop me
    entering the network as a nice guy and selling
    my checks to the highest bidder?
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>
CAcert had few answers to these questions, but with some
prodding, several responses evolved.

<ul><li>
    The existing network was accepted, as:
    <ul><li>
        it had been in operation for many years,
      </li><li>
        few problems had surfaced during that time, and
      </li><li>
        the incumbents had little
        incentive to pervert the network.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>
    Checking, or <i>verification</i>,
    needs to be the subject of objective and
    testable standards, so we need:
    <ul><li>
        A standard.
      </li><li>
        A test.
      </li><li>
        A recovery mechanism.
    </li></ul>
</li></ul> 

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Challenge for Assurance</b></center>
  <br><br>add to current system:

    </li><li>

  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
    Such things did not exist,
    although some things did fill their places.
    A wiki with a lot of ideas and procedures
    served as documentation,
    and testing was more done by the
    <i>practical but informal</i> check of
    experienced Assurers working with newer Assurers.
    However, these were unreliable.
    Firstly, there had not been a solid grounding on
    what Assurance should be, and the wiki varied in
    its treatment.
    Secondly, not only was any checking subject
    to obvious variation,
    it also tended to encourage the variations to bed in
    and become divergent standards,
    often on regional bases.
    Thirdly, there was a belief that the Assurers
    were better able to judge everything themselves,
    following on from the <i>web-of-trust</i> school of thought.
</p>


<h3> Education </h3>

<p>
In order to escape from the maelstorm of variable
quality, discussion inevitably spiralled into a need
for a test.  This would be a basic benchmark which
could later be changed and tuned as experience develops.
Once the concept of testing the Assurers was accepted,
the thoughts of the techies immediately turned to creating
an online test suite.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, an experienced leader of real business projects had
turned up at the time, and agreed to take on the challenge.
CATS or <i>CAcert Automated Testing Sysem</i>
was created over the year 2007 with volunteer programmers,
and opened up for general testing of Assurers, beginning 2008.
By November 2008, 1200 Assurers had attempted and passed
what had now been christened as:
</p>

<center><big>
  <b> <a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/AssurerChallenge">
The Assurer Challenge</a></b>
  <br><br>
  <i>Have you passed the Assurer Challenge yet?</i>
</big></center>

<p>
The test is a series of around 40 questions.  The pass mark
is 80%, and a candidate can take it as many times as liked.
In essence, as well as a benchmark, the test has a learning
effect.

<p>
Unusually, CATS was built and run outside the main CAcert
environment, so there is a communication required between
CATS and CAcert.  After much discussion around privacy
and security, client certificates are required to run the
test, and the result is communicated by client certificate
number;  CATS itself does not need to know who you are,
simply that you are a Member, and your membership can
be uniquely identified to CAcert with the positive result.
This was a unique and valuable chance for the whole
organisation -- Assurers and managers -- to learn about
client certificates.
</p>

<p>
Unchallenged Assurers will lose their status,
and while the code is written to enforce that, it
remains for the switch to be thrown.
This means in effect that the body of Assurers will
shrink from some 10,000 to something under 2000.
As CAcert has been collecting these names for some
6 years now, it is reasonable to expect a dramatic
shrinkage, as well as professionally responsible
to keep the status of the data up to date.
</p>

<h3> The Assurance Policy </h3>

<p>
As mentioned above, there was no solid grounding in
what an Assurance was.
Indeed, there had even been a rule that
<i>"Assurers can do anything"</i>,
and occasionally this rule was taken to heart by
overzealous Assurers who were sure of their own realities.
</p>

<p>
Unwinding that rule took a long time.  The
first nail in the coffin was liability, as
most of the Assurers equated <i>freedom of action</i>
with <i>zero liability</i>.
However, courts would be unlikely to agree to that.
Luckily, the crafting of the risks, liabilities
and obligations project resulted in the
creation of the CAcert Community Agreement
which both formalised the liability of each
Member, collected it before CAcert's own
forum of Arbitration,
and put a limit on it.
</p>

<p>
Then, the project to build and impose the Assurer Challenge
woke Assurers up, to the extent that they knew it.
</p>

<p>
The final requirement then was an objective policy
against which the test could be written.
This was the first
major work of the newly empowered <i>policy group</i>.
As its major act of 2007, the Board had passed the
policy responsibility almost entirely to the open
mail list, and the Assurance Policy was their
first challenge.
</p>

<p>
Progress was slow.  In practice, each section had
to be argued over, and fights errupted over seemingly
trivial details.  As one detail would appear important
to one person, and trivial to another, there must have
been some merit in it.
Finally, after some 6 months of discussion, the
Assurance Policy entered into DRAFT.
</p>

<p>
The Assurance Policy has a number of notable features.
Firstly, it sets a general standard for the Assurance
of individuals.  Specifically, the Name is defined,
the documents identified, the basic check is laid out,
and the points system is established.
This finally establishes a benchline for what had
been argued in the community for a long time.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, although it is a firm policy and hard to change,
it explicitly splits out a lot of detail into something
called the Assurer's Handbook.  This is a dynamic wiki
document, nominally under control of an Officer.  It is argued
that because the threats move too quickly for policy
deliberations, then much of the day-to-day practice will be
better dealt with in a document that is not so heavily
controlled by audit provisions.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, it establishes the definitions of Assurers and
gives authority for the Challenge.

<p>
Above, we stated fairly baldly that the point of a certificate
was to provide your Identity, which might be simply seen as
recording, verifying and presenting your name in a certificate.
E.g., a recent document said
    <small>[<a href="#ref_9" name="back_9">9</a>]</small>: 

<blockquote><i>
The primary purposes [are]:
(1) Identify the legal entity that controls a website.
Provide a reasonable 
assurance to the user of an Internet browser that the website the user is 
accessing is controlled by a specific legal entity identified ....
</i></blockquote>

<p>
And further:
</p>

<blockquote><i>
The secondary purposes [are] to help 
establish the legitimacy of a business
claiming to operate a website, and to 
provide a vehicle that can be used to

    </li><li>

  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
That is fairly typical of the thinking in the CA industry.
Traditionally, the claim made to sell certificates was made
in two parts:
</p>

<ul><li>
    Before:  You need the name to trade with the person
    <small>[<a href="#ref_10" name="back_10">10</a>]</small>. 
  </li><li>
    After:  You need the name to chase the person when it goes wrong.
</li></ul>

<p>
But this is just plain wrong.
We do not need the name to trade,
the seller just needs the money
(therefore any credit card is fine)
and the buyer needs the goods
(therefore any address is fine).
With or without the name, these things work fine,
and eBay's reputation system seems good evidence of this.
The same goes for most other aspects on the net,
a good name for a person is simply not needed,
although it is more polite than a good number.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>

    (transaction costs hole)
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
Afterwards, we might need to chase the person, but the
reason is that we want to see them in court.
However, getting someone to court is only helped
marginally by having the name.  What helps more than
anything is proximity and reputation.
Sadly, the utility of all these things go down,
as we get out and on to the net,
and names in certificates suffer exactly
the same fate as everything else on the net:
it is harder to dispute as the distance increases,
and transaction costs will force most low value,
long distance disputes to be un-heard.

<p>

an Avatar, <i>Volkov Catteneo</i>
was pursued and found in real-life
    <small>[<a href="#ref_11" name="back_11">11</a>]</small>. 
The overriding factors were the location
of the person in Texas, the ability
for the system of dispute resolution to
reach that person, and the desire of the
pursuer to chase the person that far.
The name was not that important.

<p>
However, perhaps we can skip the the utility of the name
in helping us to get to court,
and just look at the forum itself.
Classical courts are too expensive over
distance, so what alternatives exist?
It turns out, quite a lot, and further,
CAcert has already put in place a mechanism,
its own forum for Arbitration.
For that, we turn to the next section.

<p>
As seen <a title="4. Risks, Liabilities and Obligations" href="#rlo">above</a>,
Audit forced on CAcert a clear exposition of
<i>Risks, Liabilities and Obligations,</i>
which in turn faced it up to a need
to control liabilities, both internally
and externally.
Externally, liabilities were controlled
by disclaiming them,
but internally it was felt that in true PKI
style, Members should be able to RELY on certificates.
</p>

<p>
How then was this reliance to be controlled?
How were the consequent liabilities to be
disputed, allocated, and recovered?
Any court case would be too expensive for any Member to
think useful, which led CAcert to look at
<i>Alternate Dispute Resolution</i>.
In the event, it was decided to put in place
binding Arbitration amongst Members.
A set of rules was written, and at the September 2007 meeting
of the Board, the policy was approved
    <small>[<a href="#ref_12" name="back_12">12</a>]</small>. 
"Out of an abundance of caution," this and other policies
were also presented
before the Annual General Meeting of the Association, and
to the newly-empowered policy group.
As of November 2008, seven cases have been
dealt with and one is pending
    <small>[<a href="#ref_13" name="back_13">13</a>]</small>.

<h3> Some Classical Advantages </h3>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>The Arbitration Act</b></center>
  <ul><li>

    </li><li>

    </li><li>
    Courts refer cases where appropriate
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration">
Arbitration</a>
is a method of dispute resolution that is conducted
outside of the normal courts, but is backed up by the
normal law which those same courts work to.
This law is commonly called
<i>The Arbitration Act</i>,
an Act passed in most countries
    <small>[<a href="#ref_14" name="back_14">14</a>]</small>. 
The import of this is that courts are generally at peace
with the practice of Arbitration.  Indeed,
courts will refer cases to Arbitration, and do so happily.
</p>

<p>
The strength of the Arbitration system in CAcert derives
from the Arbitration Act found in most countries.
Here is a brief description of the advantages for CAcert:
</p>
<br><br>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Strengths</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Tuned.  Expertise.  Cheap.
    </li><li>
    other roles
    </li><li>
    Avoid cost of court
    </li><li>
    one law, forum <i>for everyone</i>
    </li><li>
    Non-related Persons can enter
    </li><li>
    fewer rules:  <i>file a dispute<big><b>!</b></big></i>
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<ul><li>
    Arbitration can be tuned to the needs of the community,
    the costs can be aligned to the nature of the disputes,
    and the experience needed can be relied upon to be available.
    CAcert appoints senior and experienced
    people in as Arbitrators,
    which helps to maintain high
    expertise in technology, and reduce costs.
  </li><li>
    Arbitration can be turned to fill other roles,
    outside strict "disputes."
    For example, CAcert can consider a lost password,
    a phishing attack, or the data protection issues
    behind an account closing in the same forum.
  </li><li>
    The CA can avoid costly and fraught court cases,
    because (within some limits) the courts will refer
    a dispute back to our Arbitration,
    citing that country's Arbitration Act.
  </li><li>
    The forum can choose for itself the law,
    and the rules.
    These can be applied <i>universally</i>
    and <i>equivalently</i>
    to all of the community, which to a large extent
    will protect individuals from
    strange and sometimes dramatically harsh
    treatment in a strange and faraway jurisdiction.
  </li><li>
    It is possible to invite non-related persons in,
    and give them some satisfaction, again,
    within manageable bounds.
  </li><li>
    It avoids the "rules-based" approach to security
    so prevalent in documentation and quality approaches
    today.
    Instead, rare conditions are referred to an independent
    but experienced party to make a determination.
    This reduces the documentation and policy substantially
    by replacing large and complex rules with the three
    most valuable words in the CAcert book:
    <i>file a dispute.</i>
</li></ul>


<h3> What holds up the Rose? </h3>
<p>
<a title="6. Assurance - What's in a Name?" href="ap_name">Above</a>,
we saw a claim that
perhaps the real benefit that users want behind
certificates is to get their counterparty into court.
Arbitration can be seen as a mighty fine substitute to
the more conventional courts, and in this it answers
to that real need.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Grasp the Stem</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Arbitration gets Member to forum
    </li><li>
    Assurance now looks to wider issues:
      <ul><li>

        can Arbitrate
      </li></ul>
    </li><li>
    Result <i>of all</i> is useful
    </li><li>
    Name is detuned
    </li><li>
    Still useful, no longer critical
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
The original Assurance Programme has always
provided a pretty good basis for verifying
the Member's Name.
And in its improved version, with a policy,
formal Handbook and tested Assurers,
it provides a good <i> and solid </i> basis.
</p>

<p>
But the true strength of Assurance is now found elsewhere
than the conventional check on Identity documents.
A CAcert certificate now makes five important claims about
a holder, taken from the Assurance Policy
    <small>[<a href="#ref_15" name="back_15">15</a>]</small>. 
They are, briefly:
</p>

<ol><li>
    That the holder is a Member,
  </li><li>
    That the Member has an online account,
  </li><li>
    The certificate identifies the account and Member,
  </li><li>
    The Member can be brought to Arbitration,
  </li><li>
    Some details such as the Name are known.
</li></ol>

<p>
It is the 4th one that is key here:
With the Binding Arbitration clause of the CAcert Community
Agreement, the Member has agreed to stand
before a peer as <i>respondent</i>, as will the
initiator of the dispute, <i>claimant</i>.
Typically, many of the systems and policies of the CA
are now oriented towards this goal.
</p>

<h4> How this happens </h4>
<p>
In a hopefully fair and open manner, the CAcert
Arbitrator will hear the dispute, and deliver a binding ruling.
At the Arbitrator's disposal is a list of remedies,
from mild to severe:
from community work days and loss of status (points)
up to &euro;1000 of fines and ultimately ejection.
</p>

<p>
Accepting all the above, we can finally get to the end
of this long path to understand the big shift in
Assurance: the Name within the certificate
is no longer (as) important for reliance, as CAcert
has other methods to encourage Members to behave.
To some extent, the Name is now reduced to a cosmetic
issue, and this matches the reality of the net far better.
In the general Internet use-cases we know of,
it is probably not necessary for you or your counterparty
to have a detailed, verified Name,
but an Assured Member can certainly put it
in there if you want.
</p>

<p>
(As an exercise, the reader may like to work through
what happens when disputing a certificate holder without
any strong name in it, whether absent or a nickname.)
</p>


<h4> For Everyone Else Out There </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Everyone Else?</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    NRPs not permitted to RELY!
    </li><li>
    NRPs can file a dispute?
    </li><li>
    no monetary remedies
    </li><li>
    punishment still possible
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
There are limits.
An important one is that the possibility of remedies
by Arbitration is not necessarily available to all.
Let's examine that.  The offer made to Internet
users states that the person is <b>not permitted to
rely on the certificate</b>
    <small>[<a href="#ref_NRP-DaL" name="back_NRP-DaL">NRP-DaL</a>]</small>. 

Yet, the dispute resolution rules clearly
permit that anyone may file a dispute
    <small>[<a href="#ref_DRP" name="back_DRP">DRP</a>]</small>. 

<blockquote><i>
Any parties that are not Users and are not bound by the CPS are given the opportunity to enter into CAcert and be bound by the CPS and these rules of arbitration. If these Non-Related Persons (NRPs) remain outside, their rights and remedies under CAcert's policies and forum are strictly limited to that specified in the Non-Related Persons -- Disclaimer and Licence. NRPs may proceed with Arbitration subject to preliminary orders of the Arbitrator. 
</i></blockquote>

<p>
Superficially, these two provisions seem to be
a contradiction, but actually they work together.
Although
any non-related person can file a dispute into
the CAcert forum against a certificate holder,
the Arbitrator is not likely to give that person
any monetary compensation.
If they are not permitted to rely, then,
and have still got themselves into harm's way,
then they have taken matters out of CAcert's
hands and into their own.
</p>

<p>
Yet, the absence of compensation to the person
does not mean the absence of punishment to the
Member.  Indeed quite the reverse is possible,
and the Member could find himself punished
according to a list of remedies listed in the
rules.  Some are benign or soft, such as a day's
service to the community or the loss of status (points),
but the Arbitrator has the power to fine up
to &euro; 1000 or to eject the person from
the Community.
</p>

<h3> Other Incentives of Great Benefit to Audit </h3>

<p>
There are other incentives which assist Audit immeasurably,
and explaining them may help to understand our enthusiasm
for the project.
As well as the above roles, it can also,
as a process and procedure reach into much broader areas:
governance, support and diplomacy.
</p>


<blockquote><table border="1"><tr><td>
<b>Arbitration as a method of Dual Control.</b>
Consider support actions to fix a "lost password"
as a trivial case of dual control.
It would work this way:
</p>

<ol><li>
    Bob, a user, mails <tt>support</tt> to get a new password.
  </li><li>
    Alice, the support operator on the day, collects all the
    information from the user, in the normal way.
  </li><li>
    Once she is convinced that she has correctly identified
    the user, as Bob, she can "file a dispute" on his
    behalf, against herself.
  </li><li>
    Trent, the duty Arbitrator, is then allocated directly to
    the case.  He calls for evidence.
  </li><li>
    Trent reads through that which Alice presents,
    as evidence, and writes and publishes a ruling
    which instructs the operator to change the password.
  </li><li>
    Alice follows the ruling and changes the password.
    In the appropriate support form, she enters in the
    ruling date and index number into the field that asks
    for her authorisation.
  </li><li>
    Later on, an audit process scans through all of the
    password changes, and matches them up to the
    rulings.
</li></ol>

<p>
Obviously this process is more complex than the
routine act of a support person changing passwords
common with user-facing systems.  But CAcert online
accounts can issue certificates, so changing passwords
needs a bit more care.
The complexities more or less derive from the
requirement for dual control, not from the
usage of dispute resolution as a support mechanism.
</p>

<p>
(Note that this is a hypothetical,
CAcert does not currently do this.)
</p>
</td></tr></table> </blockquote>

<p>
Hence, where there is a requirement for dual control,
Arbitration can slot in to fill that need.
</p>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Audit Benefits</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Dual Control
    </li><li>

        documents
      </li></ul>
    </li><li>
    post-Emergency authorisation
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
<p>
All Arbitration rulings are by default public.
CAcert Members have an incentive for CAcert to be
seen to be good, not bad.
Further, the principles of the community specifically
state, as mentioned above, that
<i>We do not act to the detriment of NRPs.</i>
These forces encourage a
fair amount of interest in the Arbitration project,
and seek to keep it working to the benefit of all.
</p>

<p>
One exception has to be noted:  Arbitration is about
<i>civil disputes</i> and not <i>criminal cases</i>.
In the event of prosecution, a judge will not refer such a
case over to Arbitration;  but it should be noted that
pretty much all of the analysis holds, and CAcert
remains in a better position in criminal cases
with Arbitration than without.
</p>

<p>
What then happens if a civil case in Arbitration
drifts into criminal matters?
Likely, a case will move along and document its findings.
A civil case is not a trial, and provides no real protection
against a prosecution of the Member.
On the other hand, any ruling will be of interest to a
court.  The ruling should provide greater certainty,
and a lesser cost, even to the extent that it may end up
contributing much to the expert needs of the later forum.
This is a positive for the Community.
</p>

<p>
What about the other way around:  a prosecutor launches
the proverbial legal strike against CAcert or the Members?
Again, the Arbitrator steps in to help.
If the court's order is for information, this cannot
be provided in the general case because nobody has
authority to provide anything but public information.
Hence, anyone subject to a court order is required
to file a dispute to get the authority.
This becomes an essential dual control on all secrets,
helping to keep them safe, and only revealed under
proper circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, the process for emergency actions and breaches
(where the latter might be by any means) benefits.
According to the principles of governance,
Administrators are not permitted to make changes without
controls in place, and that includes installing new patches
that might stop attacks.  Bad things sometimes happen,
and when they do, the rule is that the administrator must
act according to best judgement, but must then
<i> immediately file dispute against self.</i>
The dispute before the Arbitrator then leads to the
Arbitrator reviewing the actions, likely delivering
a post-event authorisation, and possibly delivering
further guidance or even sanctions where events were
not well handled.
</p>

<p>
In practice, then, although the person out on the
Internet is <i>not permitted to rely on the certificate</i>,
there are substantial and solid reasons why a CAcert
certificate can be considered to be a reliable thing.
</p>

Over time, CAcert's dispute resolution has evolved to

policy or practice, and some of which have evolved
into actual cases:
</p>

<ul><li>
    <i>The original motive.</i>
    Resolution of disputes surrounding relying party
    actions related to certificates.
    E.g., Member-to-Member certificate issues.
  </li><li>
    An offered response to disputes from external parties,
    within the softer scope of the wider browser user.
    That is, we may disclaim liability to the browser user,
    but we do not discourage a fair hearing,
    and this may still lead to a sanction against a Member.
  </li><li>

    such as the revealing of privacy information.

    A way to ignore defer tricky cases from slavish documentation.
    Where a policy becomes fraught, it can cut away
    the complications and terminate simply with
    "file a dispute."  A live, experienced
    human reviews and rules on the case.
  </li><li>
    A training exercise, a teacher of the rules and ways of CAcert.
  </li><li>
    A way to build up knowledge, by means of the records
    of the cases (primarily, Rulings).
  </li><li>
    A bridge between technology and the law, a way to
    bring them together comfortably.
  </li><li>
    A unifying layer for all Members, especially effective in
    smoothing out the diverse and often arbitrary laws found
    in some jurisdictions over matters of technology and security.
  </li><li>
    A way to protect Members against arbitrary use of civil procedure.
  </li><li>
    A bulwark against liability for civil actions,
    achieving something akin to an insurance policy.
  </li><li>
    A powerful tool in power-sharing.
    As Arbitration has the power to strike down or rewrite
    Management actions and Policy approvals, this protects against either
    of those two bodies from getting too powerful or out of control.
  </li><li>
    A reflective body that allows the principles and
    missions of the Members to surface and impact the operations.
  </li><li>
    A CAcert Arbitrator is a representative and diplomat for the
    entire body community;  and has to stretch to draw all interests in.
</li></ul>

<p>
With so many advantages, it is no stretch to see that
the dispute resolution system pays for itself in its
flexibility.
At the time of writing, there have been a handful of disputes
on the issue of <i>What's in a Name?</i>,
and now one serious dispute on the issue of the closure
of an account.  The issues were complex, but the Arbitrator
surmounted them, and ruled.  Others can now follow that ruling
and build upon it.
</p>



<h4> Criticisms of Arbitration </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Criticisms</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Avoiding the Law?  Rules &amp; Law

    Bias?  must be open and careful

    Lawyers?  expertise &amp; value

  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
There are many
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration#Advantages_.26_disadvantages_of_arbitration">
disadvantages</a>
and these are widely discussed in legal circles.
Here are some of the controversies experienced to date:
</p>

<ul><li>
    As paraphrased by a learned friend of mine,
    <i>"Conducting Law without a licence!"</i>
    <small>[Sir Edward Coke]</small>
    Although somewhat surprising, it is intentional.
    The experts in the subject matter are the senior
    Assurers in the CA, and the rules are not so much
    the law, but the policies.
    Indeed, the Arbitration Act generally encourages
    the deferral of specialist cases to bodies better
    informed of their peculiarities,
    albeit still under the general rubik of the law.
  </li><li>
    As Arbitrators are chosen from within the
    community, they are not necessarily free of bias.
    This is probably reasonable for internal disputes,
    but could be reasonably questioned for disputes with
    those who are not Members.
    A future dispute with a third party vendor, for example,
    might seek a more independent panel.
  </li><li>
    <i>No lawyers!</i>
    Again, this is intentional.
    The disputes within CAcert are low-value,
    procedural and generally non-antagonistic.
    Reasonable people can disagree on simple questions such as
    <ul><li>
         does the Member have the right to see an Assurer's status,
      </li><li>
         whether a middle name is J or John, or
      </li><li>
         can an ex-Member demand the removal of all details?
    </li></ul>
    Lawyers are not going to help with such community issues,
    or at least, they can only do so at high cost.
    It should be possible for the subject expertise
    and the professionalism of the insiders to offset
    the lack of legal training, and to date there has been
    no evidence to the contrary.
  </li><li>
    No training, no professional guild.
    This is more a reflection of youth.
    The only way forward is forward,
    CAcert needs to get a few cases done,
    and follow a natural progrssion.
</li></ul>




<h4> The Rold of Audit in the Question of Arbitration </h4>

<p>
As we saw above, Arbitration changes the character of
Assurance quite a bit.  More importantly for this author,
it makes questions of auditing the quality of Assurance,
and most other areas, much more tractable.
Before, auditors had to ponder the imponderable:
what identity document is better, are 3 middle names
too many, and how do we deal with those foreign
characters?
</p>
 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Results for Audit</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Dual Control
      <ul><li>

        </li><li>

    </li><li>

    </li><li>
    complexity can be deferred: less doco
    </li><li>
    Community can govern itself
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
Now, Audit can look at whether the system leads to
a process of resolution of disputes, and that,
once filed, the process
leads to a just, fair, efficient, and open result
in any hypothetical problem at hand.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, there are details of how we travel from
Membership and Assurance to reliance and usage,
and thence to Arbitration and a ruling;
these details are not trivial.
They might be expensive, in time and resource.
There can still be problems in any given case.
</p>

<p>
Yet, for all these costs,
CAcert has surmounted the barriers,
has conducted a handful of Arbitrations,
and has delivered results,
all of which has served the Community well.
Arbitration is workable, it is efficient, and 
complete.  The system applies across broad
swathes of policy and practice, making the
audit process much simpler.
Even better, it goes further in
reducing the role of the Auditor,
as <i>any Community Member can review the rulings</i>.
That which is open and is verifiable by the public
does not need to be audited.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps best of all, it has finally given the
certificate some sense of the value and pride,
promised to it.
</p>


<h4> Grasp the Stem </h4>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Grasping the Stem</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Claim:  of Community
    </li><li>
    Backed:  file a dispute
    </li><li>
    Accurate, not deceptive, useful, cheap
    </li><li>
    Aligned:  disputes, costs, net, proximity
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
<p>
In summary,
CAcert has therefore established:
</p>

<ul><li>
    The certificate makes a claim: that the holder is
    <i>part of the Community</i>.
  </li><li>
    The claim made by the certificate is backed:
    <i>anyone can file a dispute against that person</i>.
  </li><li>
    The claim itself is accurate and not deceptive --
    if disputes can be filed.
  </li><li>
    The claim is useful --
    if filed disputes result in a fair hearing
    and a fair ruling.
  </li><li>
    At least, the claim is as useful as any other is made.
  </li><li>
    The process is cheap.  It might or might not be free
    (fees are permitted under the policy but not currently
    charged)
  </li><li>
    The process (or its costs) is aligned with
    potential areas of disputes rather than against
    (as happens with the courts).
    Any disputes over certs are probably low,
    and any large disputes should involve 
    the time of volunteers
    who follow the incentive to maintain
    good reputation of the Community.
  </li><li>
    It creates its own jurisdiction, and therefore works
    without additional boundaries (and more costs) for
    all Members wherever they are.
    Proximity is created for all Members,
    the tyranny of distance is gone.
</li></ul>

<p>
Is this the first time ever that a CA has done something that
is both robust and potentially useful with certificates?
Perhaps this might be an exaggeration, but
it does seem that the CA industry's 14 year
obsession with the One True Name
has been taking us down the garden path.
Instead of sniffing roses,
we should be grasping stems:
methods to hold subscribers to account
are neither difficult nor expensive,
and giving something of value and subsance
to relying parties might make certs more popular.
</p>

<p>
This might or might not be the first time
that a certificate's promise
is backed up with something of substance, and is not deceptive,
however, barriers still remain:
we still have to show that certificates
can do more of service than act as gatekeeper to crypto.
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="org">   8. Organisations </h3>

<p>
Everything in the foregoing concerns <i>Individuals</i>,
and it is fair to say that the system of individual
Assurance was reasonable to begin with, and is now stronger.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Organisation Assurance</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    poor doco
    </li><li>
    unresolved conflicts in process
    </li><li>
    will likely miss the boat
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
Not so with Organisations.
For reasons that we can only speculate on, Organisations
that are assured in CAcert have never looked as sweet.
</p>

<h3> Situation in 2006 </h3>
<p>
When the audit first started up, these were the issues:
</p>

<ul><li>
    Organisation Assurance was not documented.
  </li><li>
    The standard at the time was by reference to local law.
    This might sound promising, but problems occurred:
    <ul><li>
        It dramatically reduced the applicable number of
        organisations.
      </li><li>
        Especially, it discriminated against
        many of CAcert's supporters who operated small
        self-owned businesses.
      </li><li>
        It created a standard that was at odds with the
        philosophy and style of CAcert.
      </li><li>
        The standard of one country was thought to be good
        for all countries.
      </li><li>
        Which created a trust war as different
        cultures fought to export their view of trust
        to other areas.
    </li></ul>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Dis-Organisations</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    no doco
    </li><li>
    reference to local law
      <ul><li>
         discrimination
        </li><li>
         principles
        </li><li>
         export
      </li></ul>
    </li><li>
    reserved to specialists
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
    These things derived from a false assumption that
    *only* the standard in legal registrations was good
    and applicable, with no thought as to the many and
    varying circumstances in the wider world.
    The CA's own requirements were thought irrelevent,
    and the people who were disadvantaged could not
    "compete with the law."
    This quickly become ludicrous, because the one
    country that championed this approach was
    considered over-strict by its neighbours,
    thus leading to a monopoly on issuances.
  </li><li>
    The method of verification of Organisations
    was reserved to those with juridical training.
    Again, this might sound good, but in practice it
    reduced the number of people available,
    and it allowed an <i>appeal to authority</i>.
    In the end, it became a way to assert the above
    political view that one country's regime of
    registrations was good enough for all,
    and an easy excuse for no standards nor training.
</li></ul>

<p>
Even as audit was looking into the basic form of Individual
Assurance, the war was brewing.
Within the one leading country, trouble erupted when some
people discovered that certain forms of organisations were
to be completely rejected because the form of proof was not
up to the standards proposed by the people running
Organisation Assurance, and there was no intention to
change that.
</p>

<h3> Advisory's Policy </h3>

<p>
At CeBIT of March 2007, enough evidence was presented
to conclude that, at the least, the Board had no control
over the process.
To address this, I stepped in and put a
stop to all Organisation Assurance until a policy
was developed and placed into at least DRAFT.
Advisory got together one weekend
and knocked up a working draft of an
Organisation Assurance Policy
    <small>[<a href="#ref_16" name="back_16">16</a>]</small>. 
This was approved by the new Board as its first major
policy at the September 2007 meeting.
</p>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>New OAP</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Organisation Assurance Policy
    </li><li>
    creates SubPols
    </li><li>
    any form of "organisation"
    </li><li>
    in DRAFT for USA and Euro corporates
    </li><li>
    bar:  testng, training, Assurers
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
<p>
The new Organisation Assurance Policy (OAP)
was a reasonably good effort.
It had one endearing feature:  it split off all the different
forms of organisation into what are called Subsidiary Policies,
or SubPols.  This meant the unwinding of the assumption that
organisations are only formed according to local law, which
paved the way for the different forms to challenge and be
recognised.
To do that, OAP says that
a SubPol has to be written to recognise each form.
These are are mostly on national lines, but do not need to be.
Currently, there are works in progress for the USA and Europe.
</p>

<p>
It also specified some measures of dual-control, and raised
the bar on the administration:  all involved have to be
Assurers, and tested and trained.
</p>

<h3> More Cracks </h3>
<p>
Organisation Assurance was unfrozen by this new policy.
However, as the audit itself remained frozen,
OA was never properly tested.  Meanwhile, over time,
new information emerged that underscored
more issues:
</p>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Cracks...</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    lack of doco
    </li><li>
    action on the OAP?
    </li><li>
    Orgs can set CommonName to anything?
    </li><li>
    who was responsible?
    </li><li>
    mass-manufacturing ?
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
<ul><li>
    The process of Organisation Assurance did not get the good
    documentation efforts that Individual Assurance had, and it
    remained poorly documented.  In particular, there is no
    Handbook for Organisation Assurance to document the
    practices.
  </li><li>
    Although the OAP raised some new standards, there was never
    any news that indicated these new standards were being
    pushed through to the coalface.
  </li><li>
    Complaints emerged that the organisations had a special
    feature, being that they could set the certificate's CommonName
    to anything they desired.
    Corporate users will see the sense in that,
    but Individual Members asked how it was that
    there was no control on this process?
  </li><li>
    Given the success of the risks, liabilities and obligations
    project, and the consequent Agreements,
    a new realisation came about:
    the policy did not make it clear who was responsible for
    certificates issued to organisations:
    the organisation itself, the administrators or the holders?
    Given the normal ability of organisations to duck and weave
    when the trouble starts, this was no good.
  </li><li>
    Another complaint emerged: that organisations had an ability
    to mass-manufacture certificates.
    This was felt to be crucial, but it also raised questions
    as to responsibility for keys.
    As the Individual Members had strong obligations to look
    after keys, something was needed on the Organisation side,
    else imbalances would occur.
</li></ul>
    
<br><br>
<h3> The all-knowing, all-seeing Certificate.  Or not? </h3>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Sub Rosa</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Is the Name reliable or not?
    </li><li>
    Orgs can set the CommonName how they like.
    </li><li>
    arguments both ways
    </li><li>
    Policy Group:  <b>all info is Verified</b>
    </li><li>
    onus: define how CommonName is verified
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
<p>
To resolve at least one of these issues, we examined the
question of whether an Organisation could set the CommonName
arbitrarily.
Org people wanted it so, others did not.
After some months, we gradually were able to reduce the
discussion to one question:
</p>

<blockquote><b>
    Is all information in the certificate <b>Verified</b>
    or is it not?
</b></blockquote>

<p>
This might have gone either way.
From a PKI perspective, there is no reason for all the
information in the Certificate to be verified, partially
or totally, as this is the domain of the CPS and the
Relying Party Statement.
What is verified is a business decision of the CA;
the point of PKI certificates is to deliver claims,
and those claims are meant to be
documented and defined in the CPS
    <small>[<a href="#ref_17" name="back_17">17</a>]</small>. 
It is a central tenent of the PKI architecture
that relying parties read the documentation and
rely on those claims as they are documented.
As we saw
<a title="6. Assurance - What's in a Name?" href="ap_name">
above with Names</a>,
claims can be strong or weak, and this is distinct
from their utility.
</p>

<br>
<p>
With some too-ing and fro-ing, this was pushed around the
policy group until people realised the simplicity of the
question, and voted:
</p>
<blockquote><b>
    Aye!
</b></blockquote>


<p>
Yes, as it happens, in CACert,
all information in the certificate is to be verified,
and everyone without exception agreed on that.
Which solved the CommonName issue <i>in principle</i>;
now the Org people have to figure out how the CN is
verified.  And document it.
</p>

<br>
<h3> The Relying Party Statement </h3>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>What do Certs say?</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    what can we rely on?
    </li><li>
    Relying Party Statement:
      <br><br><b>
          All information in the certificate is Verified.<br>
          Certificates are only issued to Members.
      </b></br>
    </li><li>
    chain: Assurance &hArr; Certificate &hArr; Reliance
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
<p>
As a postscript, this also solved another great need, the
Relying Party Statement.  Because there was so much emphasis
in the criteria on the ability of people to really know what
was going on, I felt that a strong, simple and clear statement
was needed.  Armed with the above, the Relying Party Statement
fell out fairly simply:
</p>

<blockquote><b>
    All information in the certificate is Verified.<br>
    Certificates are only issued to Members.
</b></blockquote>

<p>
Followed by pages of notes explaining why these things are
important, of course.
</p>

<br>
<h3> Time </h3>

  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Slowing of Audit</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    One issue took months.
    </li><li>
    Too slow.
    </li><li>
    Audit is delayed
    </li><li>
    OA will miss the boat.
  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
<p>
This one issue took around two months to resolve,
and the rest remain unresolved.
The people involved in OA were not able to resolve
these complaints
and shortfalls in anything approaching reasonable time,
and the policy itself was now seen to be full of holes.
For this reason, Organisation Assurance remains out of reach
for audit purposes.
</p>

<br><br>

<h2 id="sys">   9. Systems </h3>

<p>
The systems of CAcert are fairly simple.
One small server signs the certificates.
One big server runs the PHP-website,
and the database, and includes the link
to the signing server.
This latter link does not use standard
internetworking stack protocols, and instead
uses a custom serial byte-by-byte protocol.
</p>

<h3> A Slightly ad-hoc Security Modelling </h3>

<p>
This then requires strong controls over the
systems:  physical and logical access control,
and security from Internet attacks.
Beyond the obvious -- protection from hacking --
this audit has concentrated on balancing out
protection against the wider and higher threats.
This firstly requires an attention to the threats,
then a view over the defences.
</p>

<h4> The Threats </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Threats</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    bad certs
    </li><li>
    data breaches
    </li><li>
    root keys
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
Threats for CAs are collected approximately
into these three buckets:
</p>
<ul><li>
    <b>Bad certificates</b> resulting from hacking,
    account compromise, malware, code bugs,
    social engineering or the like.
  </li><li>
    <b>Data breach</b>
    or more precisely the loss, breach or otherwise compromise
    of lots of user data.
  </li><li>
    <b>Root key</b>:  loss or breach or otherwised compromise
    of the root key or any subroot key.
</li></ul>

<p>
Against which the CA mounts the following defences.
</p>

<h4> The First Line of Defence - Community </h4>

<p>
One thing at its core dramatically helps CAcert to
achieve a suitable security level:
the persistent focus on community.
This created the climate for several defences.
Firstly, it paved
the way to expressing in the CPS that CAcert
served its <i>Community</i>, as well as any
<i>community-minded organisation</i>:
It deliveres certificates
that were good for small businesses, internal
security, not-for-profits, and other small organisations.
In contrast, CAcert does not recommend its
certificates for high value ecommerce.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>1st Line of Defence - Community</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    certs are "for us"
    </li><li>
    reliance between Members
    </li><li>
    control harm done outside
    </li><li>
    dispute resolution binds it together
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
Secondly, the very strong relationship between all
of the Members, backed up be a real forum wherein
disputes can be dealt with, meant that
reliance is much better defined,
controlled and contained.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, that same ability, bolstered by principles,
will control harm done to those outside the membership,
albeit at the industry standard level of financial
liability:  zero.
</p>

<p>
This line of defence covers fairly well the case of
bad certificates.  In the event, file a dispute.
If security of the website or the user accounts
or procedures is found faulty, this will come
out in the case, which will then identify the area,
and feed through a fix;  the loop is closed.
</p>

<h4> The Second Line of Defence - Data reduction </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>2nd Line:  Data Reduction</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    oriented to mass breach
    </li><li>
    data: website, Assurers, certs
    </li><li>
    attention to Identity Fraud<br>
     --<small><i> what info?</i></small>
    </li><li>
    no photocopies, ID#s, credit info
    </li><li>
    Date of Birth
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
In the event of individual data breach,
the Community defences outlined above covers
the territory,
because it puts in the strong feedback mechanism
that finds the best balance.
</p>

<p>
That line deals less well with a mass breach,
in that, if all or most user data is compromised, 
it is possible that any remedy might overwhelm the
Community.
Luckily, the organisation has always maintained
a philosophy and style as a <i>privacy organisation</i>,
and has fairly strong controls over the privacy of
indvidual data.  This has improved over time:
</p>

<ul><li>
    Assurance information maintains very limited
    personal details:  name, date of birth, email address.
  </li><li>
    This is in several places:

        credit card information.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>
    Copies of (now) not permitted data are to be destroyed.
</li></ul>

<p>
In today's security world, data breach is probably
the number one concern.  For this reason,
this audit has looked very closely at this issue.
    The only weak point here, in my opinion,
    is the Date of Birth, which is frequently
    and shamefully used as personally identifying
    information in other online systems,
    hence has some use in Identity theft.
    This was strongly debated within the CA,
    and ultimately the CA concluded that keeping
    date of birth is an acceptable risk.

<h4> The Third Line of Defence - Online Systems Security </h4>

<p>
CAcert employs the normal approach
an array of firewalls, LAMP, SSL, SSH and so forth.
The sore thumb is PHP, which is not really
a language noted for its security pedigree.
This weakness was seen in a recent public disclosure.
The good news was that the board responded quickly
and well;  the bad news was that the bug was
fundamentally old and well known:
(<tt>register_globals</tt>)
This is a black mark.
</p>

<p>
But there is a more important result:
the process is now in place, and is working.
Bugs are being found and fixed.
This is good.  In any system of security,
a breach is a positive thing, because it gives
confidence that there is a security process in
place;  whereas the absence of any event eventually
perverts any good security into a facade.
</p>

<h4> The Fourth Line of Defence - Systems Architecture </h4>

  </td></tr></table>
<p>
The problem with all classical anti-hacking systems
security approaches is that software is often
not as good as one claims, and software is too hard
to check easily.  For this reason, good
software follows the old military principle
of <i>defence in depth</i>.  That is, many
layers, many nodes, all of which can be breached
individually without causing disaster.
</p>

<p>
Primarily CAcert's architecture separates
its system into two machines,
being the online plus database server,
and the signing server.
The two servers are connected by a serial link
with a custom protocol.  This is for two reasons:
it eliminates internetworking (a.k.a. TCP/IP stack) attacks,
and it reduces the protocol elements to those essentially
necessary for the job, so it is relatively easy to log
and review.
</p>

<p>
These steps break the problem down into tractable lumps.
As above, a network-driven attack could lay waste
to the online system, but it could only request
certificates over the serial link;  these are logged
on the signing server, so the damage is firewalled.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we turn to the biggest, most common
and most destructive threat of all: insider attacks.
This is the province of governance.
It is also the major threat against such issues
as root key compromise.
Measures that are in progress or planned include:
</p>

<ul><li>
    Separation between Oophaga admins
    (responsible for hardware only)
    and CAcert sysadmins
    (responsible for data and services only).
  </li><li>
    Dual control over access to the signing server
    (and its root key) at logical and physical levels.
  </li><li>
    Separation between primary server team
    and signing server team.
  </li><li>
    Offline root, under dual control, managed
    by board.
    Online subroots, so revocation and roll-over
    of the subroots can be achieved.
  </li><li>
    Protocol for revocation of the root
    discussed and documented with Mozilla.
  </li><li>
    Vetting of systems administrators for
    conflicts of interest.
</li></ul>

<p>
These and many others are a work-in-progress,
evolving both in practice and in documented
form in the Security Manual.
There remains much to do.
</p>

<h4> Interactions and the HSM </h4>

    but remember we only have to be lucky once.

</small>
</blockquote>

<p>
The above defences also interact in curious ways.
For example, CAcert uses a separate server for
signing, but does not use commercial High Security
Modules (HSMs).  While promising an improvement
in governance through the elimination of the
insider-root attack, there are three strikes
against:
Firstly, HSMs makes a promise of absolute
security, and as
<i>"absolutely secure systems do not exist"</i>
this moves the HSM into a sort of fairy-land architecture
space that is unreliable
    <small>[<a href="#ref_20" name="back_20">20</a>]</small>. 
Secondly, the cost is both unknown and very high
    <small>[<a href="#ref_21" name="back_21">21</a>]</small>. 
Thirdly, the Community line of defence changes
the focus of CAcert's attentions, and it makes
the fairy-tale of absolute security a story not worth
repeating.  CAcert does not need to chase the highest
"military-grade" security rating,
instead it delivers usable, practical and cost-effective
security to Members.

<h4> The Requirement for Control </h4>

<p>
In retrospect, it is now possible to map where
CAcert was at the beginning of 2006, when
this audit started.
One thing was very clear from the beginning,
and that was the general requirement for
business control and governance over the systems.
That is, not only security from an external
hacker was important, but internal control
over a rogue systems administrator or some
other internal attack was considered paramount.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, this issue was raised even before I agreed
to do the Audit.  In early meetings, potential auditors
stressed that their approach would be
to strongly pursue the core principles of
<i>dual control</i> and <i>4 eyes</i>.
Criteria, general industry practice and CAcert
itself agreed as well,
so it is important to look at why this was so
hard to do, and why it took so long.
Indeed, if there was one killer issue in the
entire audit it was:  lack of control over systems.
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellspacing="5"><tr><td>
 <b> Governance - Some Classical Techniques </b>
 <p>
 Most problems with systems, and indeed with most
 businesses, come from inside the organisation.
 Defences against these issues are frequently
 termed <i>governance</i>, and involve a
 series of tools and tricks to help the people protect
 themselves and the organisation.
 </p>
  <slide> <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Techniques</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    4 eyes &rArr; dual control
    </li><li>

    </li><li>
    Logging
    </li><li>

  </li></ul>
  </slide>  </td></tr></table>
 <p>
 <i>4 eyes</i> is achieved when Alice
 watches the actions of Bob.
 <i>Dual Control</i> is achieved when both
 Alice and Bob are required to act in order
 to complete the task.
 Variations exist.
 </p>

 <p>
 <i>Escrow</i> is used to keep spare copies of
 important passwords and backups available to
 management.
 This addresses two threats: the potential disappearance
 of a key person,
 and the unfortunate incentive that control over systems
 gives to the rogue worker to make decisions that exceed
 managerial, business or legal bounds.
 </p>

 <p>
 <i>Logging</i> records events, or facts about the
 events for later checking.  Hopefully, the records
 themselves are resistent to fiddling, and the
 records are checked from time to time.
 </p>

 <p>
 <i>Audit</i> is used to verify that documentation
 exists to high-level objectives into procedures,
 and that the practices follow that documentation.
 Generally, it is done by a combination of external
 independent agents and internal, focussed employees.
 </p>

 <p>
 <i>Separation of Concerns</i>, especially Decisions
 from Actions.  Generally, this permits a broad view
 on the decision making, and a narrow view on the
 implementation details.
 </p>

 <p>
 Although these concepts are well known and
 universally accepted in professional organisations,
 implementing them is not easy, and not cheap.

<p>
At the end of 2006, to add to the woes of
unapproved new documentation discussed
<a title="5. The Management Story" href="#mgmt">above</a>,
the failure of the original hosting relationship
in Australia triggered a crisis within CAcert
(discussed <a href="#mgmt">elsewhere</a>).
Luckily, by then, there were sufficient additional
experienced people involved to help founder Duane,
and a plan evolved quite quickly.
In hindsight, serendipity played her part,
and afforded CAcert the opportunity to get high quality,
secure and cheap facilities with a friendly partner
in the Netherlands.  BIT, a hosting company based
in Ede, stood up and offered a rack in their bright
shining new and near-empty hosting center, with bandwidth.
As well as this, Tunix, a local high-end managed firewall
company, and international suppliers Sun and Cisco joined
in to fill the rack with the physical bits and bobs.
</p>

<p>
Dual control and 4 eyes were seized on enthusiastically,
and "our man in the Netherlands", a long time
Unix and open funding character,
rounded up a local group of sysadms from the
<i>Holland Computer Club</i>
to form the <i>physical access control team</i>.
These people were tasked with control, access
and maintenance to the hardware,
but <i>never access to the data</i>.
Their access is controlled by BIT itself.
Under a written protocol, the physical team members may accompany
sysadms from the logical team in to the data center,
and up to the rack to get console access.

<p>
This entire team, the agreement with the various
suppliers, the protocols and rules for access,
and the physical assets under control were then
wrapped up into a purpose-created non-profit foundation
named Stichting Oophaga

    <small>[<a href="#ref_22" name="back_22">22</a>]</small>. 
This was bootstrapped from funding by NLnet
and XXXX, two foundations in the Netherlands
with budgets for good works.
</p>

<p>
The entire plan came together over a 6 month period
from October 2006 to March 2007, or so.
It was complete, comprehensive, and would probably
present good account of itself before audit and
other similar inspections.
It was all good standard and familiar stuff,
and suffered from only one tiny problem:
the servers were not actually in the Netherlands.
</p>

<h3> Where Machines Went </h3>

<p>
In the Christmas period of 2006/2007, tensions were
running high due to the impending failure of the Board,
and the imminent unravelling of the local hosting facility.
A feeling of panic was in the air.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>

  </td></tr></table>
<p>
As the above-mentioned Oophaga plan was not coming
online quickly enough, CAcert decided to move
the machines to temporary locations in Vienna
   <small>[<a href="#ref_23" name="back_23">23</a>]</small>. 
As this move was looking decidely impromptu, the
episode played a material part in the decision
to freeze the audit, until we could at least
get the systems back into a state where some
sort of review were plausible.
</p>

<p>
Machines were found, a hosting location was
acquired, and the systems were moved over the
Christmas and New Year period over a few weeks.
This seemed like a tough job, done under pressure,
and done well.
</p>

<h3> Getting Control of Machines </h3>
<p>
Unfortunately, there they remained, in a temporary
rack somewhere in Vienna.
When the Dutch systems came online a month or so later,
the team converged in the Netherlands to attempt
a transfer.  Then, the issues started.
</p>

<ul><li>
    <b>Remote consoles I.</b>
    In order for
    systems administrators in remote locations
    to manage the machines, they would need
    some method of controlling the console.
    Luckily the Sun machines had some form of
    daughterboard that could control the console,
    with appropriate software.
    Unluckily, this was a mish-mash of Java applets
    client-side display,
    home grown protocols and the overall result was
    rather brittle.
  </li><li>
    And, unfortunately some home grown security.
    Just looking through the configuration menu
    was enough to raise doubts
    as to the overall suitability for a hard-core
    security mission, and experience was not any
    kinder.
    Later on, CAcert were informed by helpful support
    people that the product was not to be
    thought of as aimed at security markets...
  </li><li>
    Securing this software then led to the employment
    of SSH tunneling so as to get some uncorrelated
    confidence that all was OK.
    Then, however, the firewalls in employ turned out
    to be highly oriented towards VPN access and not
    SSH access.
    The continual series of manual configuration
    changes caused tensions and drained energy.

  </li><li>
    <b>Remote consoles II.</b>
    The combined weight of console work led to a
    search for a KVM switch that worked over the net.
    It was reasoned this would provide an easy solution
    because it would disintermediate all of the above
    issues.
    One was duly sourced, only to discover that its
    security was a facade.  Much research later
    revealed that its market was only considered to
    be within the silo-grade environments;  not on
    the wilder net.
  </li><li>
    Version differences between the machines led to
    fairly serious increases in work-load, having
    to create strategies of control for the 3 or 4
    different machines.
  </li><li>
    Meanwhile, the data requirements of the system had
    also conspired to increase console visits,
    which climbed to be approximately one per week.
</li></ul>
    

<h3> Getting Control of Systems Administration </h3>

<blockquote><i>
I love deadlines.
I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.
</i><br>
<small>
    Douglas Adams
</small>
</blockquote>

<p>
The above issues led the systems administrator responsible for
all this to suggest that the systems should stay
in Vienna, and that the enourmous work load in just
getting access to the consoles in Netherlands would
be better re-directed to more useful things.
</p>

  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
And there in Vienna they stayed.
At this point, somewhat of a divergence
developed between the "Vienna" perspective and
the "Netherlands" perspective.
The former perspective stressed
convenience, efficiency of access
and the rather compelling advantage of running systems.
The latter perspective was keen to
exploit the strong physical control,
availability of more administrators for governance,
and the high profile boost
from working with partners.
</p>

<p>
At the major meeting in September, 2007, matters
came to a head, and the Board was resolved
to move the servers by the end of the year.
Then, in an October repeat of the Australia story,
the "friendly company" hosting in Vienna unravelled,
and CAcert was required to secure yet another
hosting deal on short notice.
The Board seized on this and negotiated a
couple of months emergency hosting with
Funkfeuer, a community hosting foundation in Vienna,
and gave the systems team until the end of the year
as the deadline.
The Board also took advantage of the physical
keycard mechanisms at Funkfeuer, and thus
put in place a rudimentary form of dual
control in place with Funkfeuer sysadms providing
physical control over access and another local Foundation,
Sonance, providing contractual control.
It was an advance, on paper, and although it
was brittle and unprofessional, it was
accepted as good enough for a month or two.
Until the systems moved to the Netherlands.

<p>
Yet, by the end of the year 2007, only the
non-critical services had been moved,
leaving the "critical" machines in Vienna.
During the ensuing months work was done on
the data explosion to reduce it and to better
manage it so that frequent console visits were
not required.  This work was more or less declared
complete by around March of 2008.
</p>

<h3> An Alternative Plan </h3>

<p>
By this time, the perspectives were becoming
more entrenched.
Vienna had worked out so far, why not stick with it?
At least, that was the reasoning in Vienna.
In deliberations on this, the Board discussed and
agreed to create a new team with the express purpose
of transferring the services to Netherlands.
Budget was allocated, a team leader was
press-ganged and put on standby for the long-haul
flight into the zone.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>

    </li><li>
    hit roadblock:  security opinions
    </li><li>
    physical security declined
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
However, this plan fell over at the first hurdle.
When a difference of opinion on some random
security issue occurred, the difference bounced up
to the Board, and the Board found itself unable to
clearly resolve the issue.
Without clear support, the plan folded.
</p>

<p>
Another issue was that while Funkfeuer did a good
job as far as its purpose in life was concerned
-- a hobbyist or community hosting provider --
it had always been marginal as far as
physical security <i> for a CA </i> was concerned.
While quiet negotiations were begun to consider how
to boost up the the raw physical security, with
mechanisms such as a purpose-built locked cage,
the dual control was failing.
Dual access control was always a stop-gap measure,
as there are easy back-doors in community systems.
Somewhere around May, the front door was opened
when a keycard was helpfully given to the CAcert
systems administrator. 
</p>


<h3> The Last Chance </h3>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Impatience mid 2008</b></center>
  <ul><li>

    </li><li>
    new team needed
    </li><li>
    deadline:  end 2008.
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
Probably, the failure of physical dual control in Vienna
was the straw that broke the camel's back.
At this stage, the Board took on a more unified approach.
Audit also realised that the overall security was
deteriorating, and not improving, and this was not part
of the deal to give breathing space to CAcert to sort
out its short term difficulties.
In a series of increasingly aggressive messages,
I pushed the situation
from uncomfortable to unacceptable to downright crazy.
With no alternatives in procrastination left,
these statements were made in mid 2008.
</p>
<ol><li>
    The Vienna CA was declared <b>Audit Fail</b>.
  </li><li>
    An entirely new team was to be put in place
    of the Dutch servers.
  </li><li>
    An earlier unpublished advice to the Board was
    published:   that the existing roots were also
    declared
    <b>Audit Fail</b>.
  </li><li>
    The CA had until the end of the year 2008 to get
    the systems moved and under dual control,
    else the entire audit process would terminate.
</li></ol>

<p>
The Board then took the ultimate and unanimous decision
to shut down Vienna servers and move the services,
come hell or high water, 30th September.
A new team of Dutch systems administrators was
recruited, ready to receive.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
The decision was taken not to bring up the Vienna
servers, <i>even if the move failed</i>.
The plan called for the Vienna drives to be secured
in a remote location under control of a new
group of trusted people.
The machines were to be unpowered, dissassembled
and taken out.
There was no going back.
</p>

<p>
This would have effectively meant the end of the CA,
and that was fully understood.
This finality was clearly written,
and it may have signalled just how low confidence was:
if the new team failed, CAcert would remain off,
and at the AGM to follow a month later, a future
CAcert without a CA would be discussed.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>High Noon</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    new sysadm team in NL
    </li><li>

    </li><li>
    30th Sept:  systems moved to NL!
  </li></ul>
  <center><b>No Problems!</b></center>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
This last chance put a lot of pressure on the
new team, but more importantly it tipped the
balance and got the data moved.
In the event, on the 30th September, 3 CAcert
people brought the systems down, and packed up
the data.  One set was escrowed in the safe of
a local business; the other set was driven by
2 CAcert people to the Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
24 hours later, the data was handed to the new
team, and within another 4-6 hours, CAcert was
up again.
</p>

<h3> Why did this happen? </h3>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Why was 18 months lost?</b></center>
  <br><br>tough <i>but common</i> questions...
  <ul><li>
    did not follow the NL agreement?
    </li><li>
    managers did not manage?
    </li><li>
    demand an audit, but ignore it?
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
Why did apparently well-educated experiened
people simply not follow the basic principles
outlined and agreed at the beginning?
Why did a community of 100,000 members apparently
demand an audit and then decline to help complete it?
Why did an organisation with a fair
share of senior managers not deliver on its
agenda?
Why was approximately 18 months wasted while
this, that and the other were tried, all while
the global clock ticked for the CA, for the
community, and for every one closely involved?
</p>

<p>
These are tough questions, but I feel compelled
to attempt a perspective on them.
This is partly because CAcert
is not that different to any other similar
organisation in the open source world.
What happened to CAcert is almost certainly
relevant to every open source organisation,
and I have personally watched the same
deadlock in two other big-name organisations
in the security field.
</p>

<h4> The bad news :-( </h4>
<p>
<b>Volunteers.</b>
Everyone is a volunteer, more or less.
Although this speaks highly to loyalty, devotion
and quality, it also reveals a weakness:  nobody
can be fired.
Hence, if someone decides to go their own way,
then they can.  The worst that can be done to them
is that they are ignored.  In the open source world,
this is not such an issue, because bad code generally
gets discovered, and bad product gets replaced.
Even in
the business side of a CA, there is less of a problem
because a badly written document can be ignored or
replaced.
These things are even desirable, as good code
comes out of independent experiments, and good ideas
come out of strange places.
But it is a huge problem if they are operating the
root keys.

  </td></tr></table>
<p>
<b>Technophilia.</b>
There is an almost complete focus on all
issues as technical problems with technical solutions.
When non-technical problems present themselves,
attacking them with technical solutions is risky:
This occasionally works, and sometimes innovative
solutions appear;  indeed, it works just enough
times to reinforce a belief that all problems
are technical.
But it fails as a strategy for problems
for which there is no technical solution,
or for which we haven't yet invented the tech approach,
and there are a lot of business problems in this class.
There is a reason why MBAs do not learn rpm(1),
C, or crypto,
and absence of knowledge of these things
should not be seen as an excuse to ignore them
and download yet another package or code up
yet another feature.
</p>

<p>
By way of example, dual control, by its very
nature, requires two humans, and they must
be dealt with in a human fashion.  A focus
on tech only serves to distract from this essence.
In fact, all of governance is essentially a
set of issues requiring human solutions to
problems which we cannot yet solve in a technological
fashion.
Technology solutions applied to governance
problems seem to have a very good
record of compounding the issue unless
they are very well thought out, or lucky.
</p>

<p>
<b>Human++</b>
Technically-focussed people tend to be weak at that which is
called Human Resources.  Especially, those who have
earnt their spurs in Internet times, and have worked
in open source world, tend to see any such discussions
as akin to voodoo or tarot cards.
This tends to lead to an alternate ceremony,
where small teams of expert people discover
they need more people, agree they need more
people, and do anything but engage new people.
Generally, the ceremony repeats with more work,
more agreement, more invoking of tarot cards
and voodoo, and eventually burnout and sacrifice
of key players.
Humans do not currently download in packages,
although I am sure there is bug filed about this.
</p>

<p>
<b>More is Better.</b>
Fourthly, there is a presumption in the minds of many
people that all are trying to do the best job possible,
which is probably true, and that this means that whatever
people do is probably good, which is as probably false.
If anything, the Internet is a massive cauldron of
wasted efforts, out of which only the best survive.
What happened to the rest?  The bounty we enjoy from
the Internet process is wonderful, but it should not
distract us from the observation that much of the
work is wasted, inefficient, wrongly directed or
downright dangerous.
Why this should be mysterious is beyond me;
most code that is written is much the same:
inefficient, wrongly directed or downright dangerous
and hopefully wasted.  I include my own.
</p>

<p>
<b>Business Coding.</b>
There is a hubris about code that inspires
the junior techie to launch into convincing
and confident displays of managerial talent,
because the code works and the people use it.
Unfortunately, there is a slight yawning gulf between
<i>running code</i> and <i>running business</i>
that is not really covered in the
install manual from that most recent download.
The absence of instructions on how to fly is taken
broadly;
leaping casually into law, interfaces, psychology,
finance and other mysterious and beautiful gulfs
is common in the technical world.
</p>

<p>
The closer a person gets to the code --
coredumps!  bugs!  patches!  SVN!  --
the more a developer is consulted,
and expects to be consulted,
on all issues under the sun.
The further someone is from the code,
the more their voice is pushed away,
"he doesn't code, he's no help."
In the corporate world, this hubris is more
benign as the techie is not asked to launch into
new markets, or repair existing ones;  but the
open source world has yet to pick up on the
full market cycle.
</p>

<p>
<b>Distribution.</b>
CAcert, in common with a lot of open
source organisations, is distributed widely.
The core players derive from 6 countries and
3 continents.
This has the advantage of being able to tap skills
available from all over the world, but it has
the disadvantage of reducing communication.
Without the face-to-face, and without the persistent
presence of the manager, issues tend to roll on without
resolution, ad infinitum.
It is hard to see how to deal with this without a
fairly big budget to move these volunteers into
a single locale.  An approach that can help is to
give local teams one entire area.  For example,
systems administration is now concentrating in
the Netherlands, and the education campus was
a German project.
However, it is important for each regional team
to see themselves as players in a global world,
not as exporters of their own culture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Founder's Paradox.</b>
Finally, CAcert is the product of the entrepreneurial
process.  Innovation caused it to happen, and the
innovator that started CAcert was essential to make that
leap into the unknown.
Yet, the same innovative spirit that makes the
jump against conventional, stagnant logic possible in
the first place also blocks the movement across to
professionalism.  This is called the Founder's
Paradox, and is no different in the fully commercial
world.  Many a great company has been laid low by
this failure.
In a way, CAcert was lucky:  earlier, wiser voices
forced the Association on the Founder, the audit
process broke the deadlock, and Advisory picked up
the pieces.  But the cost of this is too high to
take cheer in it.
</p>

<h3> Is there a One-Liner? </h3>

<p>
It is all too easy to say:
the systems people did not know what they did not know,
but they were certainly inspired in their belief in it!
In time, the overwork and the hubris
conspired to shut out conflicting opinions,
and build a castle.
Students of Boyd will recognise the
self-reinforcing loop syndrome, whereby confirming data
is amplified and disconfirming data is ignored or
attacked.
</p>

<p>
The Board of CAcert had to learn this.  They had to
get over the honeymoon period and find out for themselves
that the work being done on the systems side was
flawed by a too-insular, introspective view.
Although it was "obvious" to some,
and CAcert saw experienced managers and techies
come and go because of this very frustration,
only when it became a shared truth to all was
action possible.
</p>

<h4>  But!  The good news! </h4>

<p>
This is a bad story.  It cost the audit, myself,
CAcert and every member around 18 months of delay.
To temper this, I can offer some comments on the
positive side for CAcert.
</p>

<p>
<b>Firstly</b>, CAcert has faced this issue and dealt with it.
It now has a management team and structure that can
deal with such big issues, and it is now moving on.
CAcert is certainly not up to the level of professionalism
that is standard in big companies, but
it does know what is required,
it is fighting to get there, and
it has a fighting chance of actually making the grade.
It has a shot at the title, which may be a first.
</p>

    </li><li>
     Lonely up here, too!
    </li><li>
     Nice maps, but ... they should be!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
<b>Secondly</b>, in my observation and opinion
as a professional manager,
no other similar organisation has bettered this.
Indeed, where evidence presents itself to me
(two recent cases that support direct comparison)
it tends to confirm that the other big open
organisations are not yet even at the point
of knowing that this gulf is an issue.
Lack of management and the consequent failure to
deal with anything outside the pure technical
domain is the rule, not the exception.
With practically all large open source groups,
they are experts in fixing bugs,
quoting RFCs and delivering software,
but ask them to discuss issues that
effect people, not lines of code, and they flounder.
Indeed, one observer who has the inside track
on many open source organisations recently commented
privately to me
that <i>no open source organisation had yet made the jump
to a professional management</i>.
To be fair, many open Internet organisations
do not need it, because they are not under the
imposition of an external audit or other controls,
and they are not delivering a product that is
integral to the user's security.  But, some do
have "security" in their mission, and they need
something better.
</p>

<p>
<b>Thirdly</b>, this may bring cheer to those critics who
say that CAs should be professional and commercial
organisations, and an open community has no business
entering into this security area.
The response to that is clearly, yes in part:  the
ability to hire experienced managers,
fire inexperienced ones, and the overall feedback
mechanism of the competitive market give those
players an advantage.
People and business problems will be solved,
or the company dies.
</p>

<p>
Yet, no commercial CA has solved the challenge of
delivering a useful end-to-end claim that gives some
form of tangible and decided benefit for the users of
certificates.
Whatever they deliver may be very efficiently
and professionally issued,
it just lacks any ability to impress the end-user.
</p>

<p>
<b>Finally</b>, it should be pointed out that the
only reason the business side of CAcert looks so
good and professional is that it
was given around 3 years to develop the structure,
concepts and documentation in relative peace and quiet.
If the systems had been ready in 2006, then
the lack of documentation would have killed the audit.
Stone cold dead.
</p>

<h3> Wheretofore the systems? </h3>

<p>
What now?  Sometimes when climbing a mountain,
we forget that we have to climb down again,
and move to the next one.  Let's check the map,
as of today, November 2008.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Current Status</b></center>
  <ul><li>
      Physical:  ready for check
    </li><li>
      Logical:  close, possible.
    </li><li>
      Doco: CPS + SM lack approval
    </li><li>
      X-team: future task to develop
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<b>Physical.</b>
The movement of the systems to Netherlands, now
completed, creates a regime of
<i>physical and logical separation</i>.
Oophaga is responsible for controlling the
physical access to the hardware, and will be
responsible for maintaining the governance controls
over that physical access.
Once complete, this process should be good,
and should withstand an audit scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
<b>Logical.</b>
The leader of the sysadms is
responsible for placing the logical access to
the critical systems into a governance regime.
In the past, this was impossible because the
team was just one person.
Now the team has more people, so governance is
possible.  New rules
are now in place to dual-control the logical access
over the signing server, and 4-eyes over the
primary server.
There is a limit to how fast we can expect the new
team to catch up, but once they are ready, we can
begin.  (If you are in the Netherlands, and have
sysadm skills, are not involved in any conflicting
work, then consider giving a hand.)
</p>


<p>
<b>Critical Documentation.</b>
The audit identifies and requires three critical
documents that are currently all well advanced,
but not quite there yet:
<ul><li>
    <b>Security Manual.</b>
    This should be the documentation that will bind
    the different areas together in the security role;
  </li><li>
    <b>Configuration-Control Specification (CCS).</b>
    The same requirements that are envisaged for policy documents
    such as the CPS are also imposed on software and hardware.
    Traditionally, control processes have treated these
    different classes of assets in very different forms.
    It remains to be seen how the CA will deal with this
    "simplification" but there are no obvious obstacles.
    It is simply a matter of documenting what is done
    now, comparing it against audit and other criteria,
    and improving it.
  </li><li>
    <b>Certification Practice Statement.</b>
    The CPS is the traditional primary document for
    audits and communicating with the users.
    This is well advanced.
</li></ul>

<p>
<b>Security Oversight.</b>
The security manual crosses across the entire CA,
and thus requires a similar broad focus on the part
of the people.
In the future, as the new sysadm team and SM beds in,
there may be a requirement to develop the skills in
a cross-CA basis.  This is clearly beyond the scope
of the systems administrators.
The CA needs to develop its broader security management.
Because a CA is
a security organisation, and because all aspects
bear on security, expertise in this area is an
imperitive.

<h2 id="audit">  10. Audit </h2>

<h3> What went Right </h3>

  </td></tr></table>
<p>
The Audit, following the lead of David Ross's criteria
(DRC), correctly identified an archilles heel of
certificate issuance:  risks, liabilities and
obligations.  Even better, this challenge has been met
with a strong Community allocation of liabilities,
backed up by dispute resolution.
Adding those to the CAcert Assurance Programme,
itself improved by policies, led to a thing never before
seen:  a clear story on reliance.
</p>

<p>
Arbitration is a big achievement.  Following on from
developments in other communities, this provides a
closing of the loop that simplifies a lot of CAcert's
operations.
</p>

<p>
The management aspects were heavily influenced by the
demands of Audit, and although painful at the time,
I think it undeniable that the result is far better
and stronger than the past.
CAcert's triumvurate of governance tools:
the Board, the Policy Group and Arbitration work
together like a three legged stool.  None is too
powerful, they all work better together.
</p>

<p>
The work on the Education Campus to create a testing
regime is another highlight.  Although basic to start
off with, testing and education promises a lot for
CAcert in the future.
</p>

<p>
These innovations all can proud of.
</p>

<h3> What was not Covered </h3>

<p>
There are a few areas that were not strongly
covered.

    Yes, another tricky black bit.
    One area was not covered deeply,

than I would like were looked at.
</p>

<h3> What went Wrong -- I -- Openness </h3>

<p>
This was supposed to be an <i>open audit</i>.
I always wanted to do an open audit,
I'm that sort of guy.  From my experiences
in payment systems it came out clear and
strong:  if you want security and governance,
the open, transparent possibilities are much
stronger than anything that can be done in private.
Just ask anyone in Wall Street, they will
definately see the merit of transparency
in risks.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>What went wrong -- Openness</b></center>
  <ul><li>
      DRC unpublished
    </li><li>
      work first
    </li><li>
      secrecy!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
This resonates with the open source community,
but it goes much further than that.  We call
it <i>open governance</i>, and it means opening up
all of the processes, all of the checks, all
of the information.
OK, not absolutely all.
Not the keys, passwords, not user's
PII, but ... <i>everything else.</i>
</p>

<p>
But, this audit failed to open on starting.
I have to admit that and count the cost.
</p>

<h4> DRC was unpublished </h4>

<p>
DRC was not initially released into the world.
Although CAcert had the pre-approval from Mozilla
that it needed to start the audit to this criteria,
the author had not formally published it.
In retrospect this put us in a bad position;
we were not able to clearly communicate what is needed.
Further,
the lack of exposure reduced the credibility of the
process, giving the audit a sort of fairy tale remoteness.
Finally,
it makes us look as bad as those competitors who also
keep parts of their audit process confidential,
in order to increase their power of negotiation.
</p>

<p>
Negotiations with David Ross gave us an
authoritive copy on his website.
</p>

<h4> Get Some Work Done First </h4>

<p>
There was a tremendous expectation on the audit.
Everyone wanted one, and everyone believed it
was something you could purchase at the supermarket,
if you had the cash.
</p>

<p>
In order to manage those unrealistic expectations, I chose not
to publish much detail of the audit at the beginning.
I rationalised that it would be better to plough through
the first phase, get the documents sorted out, in
place, and then announce a sort of mid-stream progress.
</p>

<p>
Big mistake!  It proved impossible to get the documents
sorted out.  Gradually, I was forced to
revealed more and more information in order to spark some
activity, by means of wiki and posts.  By the
time this was done, the chance of some momentum of a big push
was lost.
</p>

<p>
It is not clear how being tight with information at
the beginning effected the end results.
It certainly did not help, and probably caused a minimum
of harm by slowing the process down
to a crawl.  Information was not channelled and shared,
and there was not a lot of help available for the project.
So much so that when I was chatting to one of the
Board members around November of 2006, he admitted
to me that did not even know there was an audit in
progress.  He also admitted to being severely
embarrassed by this lack of information, and
it was yet another signal that things were out
of control.
</p>

<br>
<h4> Climate of Secrecy </h4>

<p>
    Like too many organisations,
    the early CAcert was obsessed
    with secrecy.
    The management discussions,
    such as they were, were secret.
    Policies, such as they were,
    were decided in secret.
    Location of hardware was a secret,
    seeing the software required an NDA.
    Sometimes it seemed that
    secrecy was the beginning, middle and end
    of conversations.
</p>

<p>
There are three issues with this.  Firstly, it
is shockingly hard to get anything done.  This
audit stalled and sputtered for a year before
I had enough evidence to pass sentence on the
Board that wasn't.
I would have known, and we all would have known,
within weeks if decisions had been published.
But instead, we had to send pings into the Board
with TTLs stretching into the months.
We can't fix what we don't know.
</p>

<p>
Secondly,
your attacker laughs at you.
The same secrecy that keeps idiots like me from
figuring out what is going on also provides cover
for the activities of a smart attacker.
Secrecy is no barrier to the enemy, and indeed
I spotted 2 governance attacks during this period,
employing CAcert's own secrecy against it.
And these were just commercial-grade goons,
heaven knows how many junior spooks the agencies
have sent on training runs.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, secrecy is the ideal cover for incompetence.
Secrecy rarely helps a good plan, but it is an excellent
tool to cover up a bad plan.
This is pretty much a constant, in that every time
I've come up against an issue,
and been told "that's secret, you can't
see that," I've discovered later that the real reason
was that the work simply wasn't correct, wasn't complete,
wasn't done, or was something else entirely different.
</p>

<p>
Indeed,
I've yet to discover a good reason for secrecy.
OK, secret keys, passwords, user data aside,
but, everywhere else?
No rationale as yet has surfaced.
CAcert was not the first to prove the rule, and
won't be the last.
</p>

<p>
Luckily I was not alone in this viewpoint.
In September of 2007, the Board agreed to make everything
open and transparent, by policy and by practice.
Anything that needs to be secret now has to be justified.
Slowly, CAcert has shed its secretive ways and now
publishes:
</p>
<ul><li>
    all its formal decisions,
  </li><li>
    Arbitration rulings,
  </li><li>
    threat security modelling.
</li></ul>

<p>
And, there is more to follow, as CAcert learns how
shedding secrecy will help it.
</p>

<h4> "Trust me" </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Trust Me!</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    is an <i>appeal to authority</i> ploy
    </li><li>
    implies we don't need to document

  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
Highly allied to secrecy was the temptation to resort
to personal <i>appeals to authority</i>,
more simply known as "Trust me!"
When people are asked about some area that needs to be
documented, and isn't, one frequent and automatic response
is to point out that the commentator is the expert, and the
work is done well.
</p>

<p>
And, by implication, we are to suppose, we do not
need to document it, or discuss it further.
The Audit has a different perspective:
</p>
<blockquote><i>
Either, <blockquote>it is written down,</blockquote>
or <blockquote>it doesn't exist.</blockquote>
</i> </blockquote>

<p>
Pick one!
The polite way of explaining this is to
point out that the one person doing the job might
get hit by a bus tomorrow, and the organisation
needs some documentation to deal with the change.
However, the reality is far sadder.  In almost all
cases, the work is done incompletely, badly,
with no quality control, arbitrarily,
and with little chance that anyone else
will be able to follow it, let alone with
any chance of external approval.
It cannot be documented without revealing these
delitos, so it is important to avoid conversation
about what is being done, at any cost.
</p>

<p>
The cost of this approach is simple:  no audit.
</p>
<h3> What Went Wrong -- II -- Independence </h3>

<p>
Independence is a central tenet of audits.  However,
it turns out that independence is at best an impossible
goal, and at worst a charade.  Where any given audit falls
in this unhappy spectrum depends on many things.
</p>
<p>
In this, independence is just like security;  there are
no absolutes.
We need to understand it in depth before relying on it,
and without that understanding, <i>it will be unreliable</i>.
Here is an attempt to shed some light on some of the
challenges to independence, in an effort to better
understand the risks that you the relying party takes.
</p>

<h4> If Crypto were a Physical Science, CAs would be in the Quantum Uncertainty layer  </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>What went wrong -- Independence</b></center>
  <ul><li>
      "observer problem"
    </li><li>
      producer
    </li><li>
      product
    </li><li>
      criteria
    </li><li>
      governance
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
There is no such thing as absolute independence;
as soon as the Auditor walks in, he effects the situation.
From physics we know it is impossible to measure
something without changing it,
and auditing displays the "Observer Problem" at a level
that is approximately quantum.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes this is for the good, in that standards are lifted
and more thought is taken before acting.
Other times it is not for the good.
People can become uneccessarily bureaucratic,
difficult, or scared.  In all cases, it makes the
real job of verifying much harder to do.
</p>


<h4> The Auditor is not the Producer </h4>


<p>
In theory, all the auditor should do is deliver an
independent opinion.
The organisation has to do the
actual work to deserve that opinion.
So, if a document is missing, the organisation has
to write it, or find it elsewhere.
If a feature is missing, the CA has to add it.
But shaking the belief that the auditor provides the
audit proved next to impossible.
From top to bottom, this was the view held.
Here are some of the motives why this was so hard to do:
</p>

<ul><li>
    Only the auditor knows what a document needs to say
    in order to pass the audit.
    Ergo, he should write it.
  </li><li>
    Not so many people are capable of writing serious
    documents.
  </li><li>
    Almost all of the active people
    in CAcert were traditionally non-native english
    writers.
</li></ul>

<p>
The first two are fallacious.  The first fails as if
the auditor writes it, nobody else need follow it.
The second fails for the same motive;
if you cannot write the policy, it also isn't your policy,
and in effect, you have no policy.
</p>

<p>
The final one is tough;  as CAcert is a volunteer organisation,
it has to deal with the volunteers that it has, and it is only
in the last year or so that alternative volunteers who can
write in high-grade English have turned up.
But it still fails to pass muster as an excuse;
as other languages can be used, good language tools
these days, and good english
can be turned relatively easily into bad english.
Indeed CAcert claims to be a leader in translations!
</p>

<p>
Either way, this is a grave dissappointment.  Although
CAcert musters 100,000 members on the books, 10,000
Assurer Candidates, and 1000 tested Assurers,
it can only find around 10 people who can help with
documents and to do work required to help the audit,
and far less than that to add the features needed.
</p>

<h4> The Audit is not a Product </h4>

<p>
Perhaps the second most disappointing thing
(after the above more pratical point)
was the attitude that the auditor is a hired
gun, and he'd better start slingin' for his supper.
This took its form in a persistent and deep belief
that the audit is a product, and not a process.
So the continual question pressed by the entire
CA was more or less reduced to the following:
</p>

<blockquote><i>
"Has the audit been done yet?"
</i></blockquote>

<p>
No such.
Many many people believe that CAcert only has value
if put in the browsers;  and most also understood the
convention that an audit is required to get it there.
Yet, there were very few people in the organisation
that stood up and said "OK, what do we have to do?"
It is as if the standard mindset was that the
audit was someone else's responsibility, when in
fact it is everyone's responsibility, and if nobody
tackles it, the game does not start.
</p>

<p>
One supposes that CAcert is not unique in this.
Indeed, if we look at other links in the food
chain, everyone outside the process also thinks
the audit is a product;  vendors, users, developers,
CAs, everyone:  once you've got your audit,
you are good, and without, you're no good.
The obsessive and wrong belief in audit-as-product is
only matched by its perverted inability
to align with the needs of its original market.
</p>


<h4> The Criteria are Your Target, not the Auditor's </h4>

<p>
The audit works to criteria, yet nobody was particularly
interested in working through that document.
No-one ever stood up and said "Where is the list of
things that we need to deliver?"
DRC is very well written, and is not hard to understand.
There are relatively few misunderstandings.
Boring, yes, but we need only take a criteria a day if it
is too heavy.
</p>

<p>
Hence it is a surprise that only very few people,
to my knowledge,
have read through even some portions of the
criteria and related this into their areas.
</p>


<h4> Governance is done by the Auditor, Right? </h4>

<p>
Governance is something done by the organisation,
but frequently there is a temptation to slot in
the Auditor in some governance role and imagine
that it is done.  The problem with this is that
(a) it is then impossible to audit that role,
and (b) it is impossible
to rely on the role being done afterwards.
Hence, an automatic audit fail.
</p>

<p>
This rather human temptation to solve a boring problem with
the nearest spare and idle Auditor is not unique to CAcert.
Indeed, the EV Guidelines includes this rather impressive
blunder:
</p>


<blockquote><i>
(e) Root Key Generation  For CA root keys
generated after the release of these 
Guidelines, the CA's Qualified Auditor
SHOULD witness the root key generation 
ceremony in order to observe the process
and the controls over the integrity and 
confidentiality of the CA root keys
produced.  The Qualified Auditor MUST then 
issue a report opining that the CA, during
its root key and certificate generation
process:  .....
</i><br>
<small> EV Guidelines, V1.0 </small>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the Auditor is now part of the governance operation,
then the ability to audit is lost.  Just the appearance
of that statement above will cause everyone to kick back
and let the Auditor do all the heavy lifting.
<blockquote><i>
   "The big cheese from KP-Anderson-Goldman-Lehman
   was there, of course it was good!  We did everything
   he said!"
</i></blockquote>
When the organisation cannot be trusted to create
its own root with its own procedures and governance,
what does that say?
Will EV++ say that the Auditor must guard the
root himself, and only let the CA see it on Sundays?
</p>

<h4> Time! Value! Recompense! </h4>

<p>
This audit took too long.  (<i>It's still going on!</i>)
An audit should be an economically efficient check,
it should not be an open-ended nightmare for all
concerned.
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Financial (In)dependence</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    too long, too much time
    </li><li>
    small retainer + expenses
    </li><li>
    Money effects independence
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
This audit has taken three years of my time,
and will take more.  Although it has not been
fulltime, the committment has still caused issues.
There are significant difficulties in doing such a long
job without recompense.
As there are significant conflicts of interest between
any audit and any other activity, there are also severe
issues with finding other employment / activities to
provide sustainability.
</p>

<p>
To address this, in the third year,
a small retainer and expenses was agreed,
thanks to good-works-funder NLnet
    <small>[<a href="#ref_24" name="back_24">24</a>]</small>. 
This level of funding does not do
more than recognise the availability.
</p>

<h4> Money! </h4>
<p>
However, once money enters the equation, it immediately
effects independence.  To recognise this, Mozilla 
stipulated rule 10 in their "criteria" or policy

    <small>[<a href="#ref_25" name="back_25">25</a>]</small>: 
</p>

<blockquote><i>
10. By "independent party" we mean a person or other entity who is not affiliated with the CA as an employee or director and  for whom at least one of the following statements is true:
    <ul><li> the party is not financially compensated by the CA;</li>
    <li> <b>the nature and amount of the party's financial compensation by the CA is publicly disclosed;</b> or</li>
    <li> the party is bound by law, government regulation, and/or a professional code of ethics to render an honest and objective judgement regarding the CA.</li></ul>
</i></blockquote>
<p>
To address yet another conflict of interest, I was
probably the one who suggested the second bullet point
(my emphasis), well before this audit started!
No matter good intentions here or there or anywhere
else, I can say that money dramatically changes any
notions of independence, and if I had any small influence
over this Mozo policy again, I would go for this:
</p>

<blockquote><i>
10. By "independent party" we mean a person or other entity who is not affiliated with the CA as an employee or director and  for whom all of the following statements are true:
    <ul><li> the nature and amount of the party's financial compensation by the CA is publicly disclosed; and</li>
    <li> the party maintains an independent state of mind; and</li>
    <li> the ultimate benificiary of the audit is the end-user of Mozilla products.</li></ul>

10.b By "independent state of mind" we mean one of the following statements is true:
    <ul><li> the party is bound by law, government regulation, and/or a professional code of ethics to render an honest and objective judgement, or</li>
    <li> the party can show by open documentation and methods of governance that an objective and verifiable judgement is rendered.</li> </ul>
</i></blockquote>

<p>
That is, there is reason to believe that if I find it
so difficult, it is likely to be difficult in other
circumstances as well.
</p>

<h4> Maintaining an Independent State of Mind </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>

  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<p>
The USA auditing practice recognises the Observer Problem,
and states words to effect that independence is a matter of
<i> preserving an independent state of mind  </i>
     <small>[<a href="#ref_26" name="back_26">26</a>]</small>. 

<p>
    Without that gem of wisdom, it is hard to see how sanity
    could prevail.
All of the above issues threatened the audit process in
one way or another, at one time or another.
And, they often challenged the independence
of the process.
I dealt with these challenges to Independence in various ways:
</p>

<ul><li>
    All policies were approved.
    Initially, by the Board, and later by the policy group.
    Hence, even though inspiration was often found from
    the Auditor, a tough approval process forced the
    ownership of the results.
    Practically, few suggestions of the Auditor
    escaped a fight, and many were bloodied.
    Often enough, Audit did not get a desired
    result and was overruled by the consensus that choose
    a different path.
  </li><li>
    Distancing from areas that had no separate review.
    Some areas were not essentially subject to any
    oversight or review, especially the systems.
    It proved impossible to get close enough to
    suggest solutions without fundamentally impairing independence.
    That is, the more "suggestions" were made, the more
    the auditor was cast in the role of manager not reviewer.
    When faced with the unacceptability of the systems,
    we had to wait for a long time for others to discover
    that and for consensus to build up.
  </li><li>
    Separating <i>role</i> from <i>person</i>.
    As seen here, we used the term "Audit" to
    de-personalise the issue from myself, and
    to focus attention on the criteria, the
    desires of Mozilla and users.
    We have also used the same process to raise
    the profile of the Arbitrator.
  </li><li>
    Forcing extra people to observe, when the viewpoint
    of others was that auditor could fill in governance holes.
    This was especially prevalent in systems areas.
  </li><li>
    Identifying who the audit is for.  No, really!
    Surprisingly, this step is rarely done, and hence, I
    had to create it.
    In this case, this Audit is for the end-users of
    Mozilla's software,
    and to a lesser extent Mozilla itself,
    but only to the extent that
    it stands in as a responsible agent for the users
    (itself a cause for concern).
  </li><li>
    Vigourously rejecting every other CA as a model.
    This was partly necessary to stop natural temptation
    to just "borrow" the documents and processes of others.
    In essence, I had to force every decision and policy
    to be made on first principles,
    and hence the result looks completely different to the
    classical commercial CA
    <small>[<a href="#ref_27" name="back_27">27</a>]</small>. 

  </li><li>
    Issuing as few instructions, or directives, as possible
    <small>[<a href="#ref_28" name="back_28">28</a>]</small>. 
    In practice, 4 or so have been issued,
    and that is 4 too many.
    Every issued instruction turns up the dial on
    apparent authority, and reduces the dial on
    apparent independence.
</li></ul>

<h3> What Went Wrong -- III -- Audit Process  </h3>

<p>
There are detailed issues that are shortfalls or
failures <i>with the audit process</i>.
These are things for which CAcert cannot be criticised
for, but instead they have to suffer,
if not in total silence.  Here are some of them:
</p>



 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Wrong III - Process</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Benefit to User?
    </li><li>
    The map
      <ul><li>
          Vendor, Standards
        </li><li>
          Business Risks
      </li></ul>
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<h4> CA Audits are not for the Benefit of the User </h4>

<p>
For several reasons, the User is not part of the equation:
</p>
<ul><li>
    The audit delivers benefit primarily to the one who pays.
    In this case it is the CA, and not the users.
  </li><li>
    As described in this document, audit criteria
    currently fluff the question of how the relying
    party is to rely, and how the end-user is to be
    protected.  DRC goes some way by insisting that
    these things be documented, and in the open, but
    it also stops short of actually requiring any
    benefit or balance for these parties.
  </li><li>
    The statement of user as customer of the audit
    is not made, or where it is made, it is generally fudged.
    It is entirely up to the circumstances whether
    the end-user is considered at all.
  </li><li>
    Representatives of users do not typically
    sit on the relevant committees,
    appear on developer groups, participate in
    anti-phishing venues or the like.
    By far the greater proportion are representatives
    of companies selling some security product or other.
    The standard of representation is generally
    lip-service as far as the user is concerned.
</li></ul>

<p>
The result of this is, predictably, the user
is forgotten in the equation.
She may be worse off than without the entire process:
She is given zero liability, and zero remedy.
She is forced to use the certificates, or
<i>not get any "protection" at all</i>.
A subscriber is required to pay for this "benefit,"
yet has zero expectation that the players will deliver
benefits against the threats to him or his customers.
</p>


<h4> Audit does not cover the map </h4>
<p>
The audit is purposed, more or less, to permit the
vendor to make a judgement call on behalf of users
and itself.
This is fine in principle, but there are flaws.
Firstly, it does not reach far enough.
Audit practice today looks like an 18th century
map of Africa, with large bland expanses 
marked simply <i>"unexplored."</i>
</p>

<p>
Let's explore.
    On the one hand, the vendor demands an
    audit, CPS, security measures, etc.;
    on the other hand, the vendor can present
    the business model of the CA, or can hide all
    this from the user.  With a few lines of code,
    the vendor can either work for the user,
    or turn off the CA's security model.
    Completely.
</p>

<p>
    Decisions taken over the last few years
    by vendors confirm this power.
    Not only does the process put the CA to great
    cost, it denies the CA any power to influence
    the security delivered to the end-user, even
    when it is explicitly written into the CA's
    model (and follows agreed PKI practices).
    The vendor therefore exerts a greater influence
    over the end result than the CA can do,
    (and, by extension, the auditor).
We might argue over whether the vendor knows more about the
CA business than the CA, or whether the CA knows more
about the users' needs than the vendor.
However, one thing is a fact:
</p>
    
<blockquote><i>
    There is no audit of the vendor.
</i></blockquote>

<p>
If indeed we accept that the audit is a necessary
part of the process,
this is a considerably vexing question.
If the users demand an audit over the CA,
then they should demand one over the vendor.
And, the two audits
-- CA and vendor -- should be aligned, from end to end.
</p>

<h4> Audit Omits the Security Leaders  </h4>

<blockquote><i>
"A camel is a horse designed by committee."
</i><br>
<small> Variously, Sir Alec Issigonis, or Vogue </small>
</blockquote>

<p>
It gets worse:  Consider that we have confidence
over the vendors, who write lots of code for
security motives.
Above, we intimated how decisions were taken recently
that indicated their willingness to change the
game entirely for the CAs.
A further issue lies in that the vendors, who hold the
power of the code, did not take those decisions
themselves, but instead routinely outsource them
other organisations.
</p>

<p>
In effect,
security leadership is outsourced by vendors.
For example,
PKIX does it for the CA interfaces, the TLS
committee for the cert and crypto layers
and now, the
emerging CAB Forum does it for the positive side
of the user interface, such as the EV "green" label.
The browsers are still preserving the decision
making with negative user interface decisions,
but this only serves to highlight how emasculated
their possibilities are.
Following on from the above, we can now note the
observation:
</p>

<blockquote><b>
    There is no audit over the standards bodies.
</b></blockquote>

<p>
There is a long distance between the approach of an
Internet standards committee and the
security of an end-user dealing with a phishing email.
It is an open question whether such a body
would survive an audit; 
a recent observation was that audit calls for
disaster recovery, whereas the PKIX struggles
with a policy of a root as a single point of failure.
One is a very standard business requirement,
the other is a theoretician's elegant structure.
Such elegance would not survive an audit process,
and it is only the separation into "in audit"
and "out of audit" that keeps the flaw in place.
This reflect poorly on the audit result;
as the audit is clearly undermined in its work
when the answer is "go and talk to committee if you
don't like it."
</p>

<h4> Audit Omits the Wider Risks, Liabilities, Obligations </h4>

<p>
This leaves the customer of the audit rather exposed,
and highlights another weakness that an audit for
business risks should have dealt with:
Security includes proper relationships between the parties.
The Audit makes a judgement call that incorporates
the effect of the following entities on the user's
security:
</p>
<ul><li>
     vendors such as Mozilla and Microsoft,
   </li><li>
     software committees such as IETF,
   </li><li>
     other parties such as CAB forum,
   </li><li>
     anti-phishing services,
   </li><li>
     and of course, CA and Auditor
</li></ul>


<p>
The judgement call has wider implications because
it relies on liability being accepted between the
parties;  as there is no contractual relationship with
many of these organisations, we must be concerned about
the clarity of the liability allocation.
</p>

<p>
This means that any situation that might involve
significant risks and liability being passed outside
the CA is going to be difficult to be clear about.
Unclarity leads to costs in any dispute.
For example, CAcert's liability position,
in common with most other CAs, passes the
liability for various actions to the user.
Is the user defined?  Is the user an end-user,
or is the user a relying party?
Is the vendor standing in as the relying party
(by dint of control of information) or is the
browser using a back-to-back agreement to pass
on the CA's liability position over to the
end-user?
Does the end-user know any of this?
</p>

<p>
There are some answers to these questions, but
they are not clear, nor unified, nor transparent.
The situation is therefore legally fraught,
and the Audit's position on making a judgement call
over the liabilities outside the CA's domain
is compromised.
</p>


<h4> Conclusions on the General Audit Process </h4>

<p>
Given all the above, what can we conclude?
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>

    Costly - against what benefit?
    </li><li>
    Other models work!
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
<b>Audit cannot respond to any developing threats.</b>
Indeed, this is what has happened.  Phishing erupted
in the early 1990s, and audit criteria and audits
themselves were powerless to respond.  DRC does no
more than document the R/L/O, and EV does no more than
document the old regime.
</p>

<p>
<b>Audit can only address security within.</b>
Because so many of the practices are outside the control
of the CA, and indeed outside the vendor's control,
there is little that Audit can do to resolve the
serious issues for the user security.
</p>

<p>
<b> Benefit to Users cannot be identified. </b>
Because there is nothing much that ties the Audit
to the benefit of the user, and because the vast
majority of audits are conducted in private, or
to complex criteria, it is impractical for any
user to determine what an Audit says to that User.
As the CA pays for the Audit and the CA has a financial
interest in the result, it takes no great stretch of
the imagination to conclude that the user is lost in
the process.
</p>

<p>
<b> Audit Costs too much. </b>
The costs of Audits are generally hidden,
but various estimates have placed it at around $250,000.
CAcert's audit has also cost that much,
if you calculate the entire package as including
the opportunity cost of the people's efforts.
</p>

<p>
<b> Other models work. </b>
It can't have escaped the notice of any audience that
models such as Skype and SSH provide real security
to millions of users, without any necessary audit.
I am not going to argue in this document about the
<i>mores</i> or the <i>lesses</i>, and it is recognised that
supporters of the audit and PKI model will contradict
this claim.  These discussions are well rehearsed elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The point however is that the audit profession has
set itself up in a privileged and safe position,
but has not delivered anything in return.
This might have been fine except for the evolution
of phishing;  the challenge that the auditors
will have is how to get the users to shed a tear
when the audit process finally is asked to show
how it is delivering value -- to users.
Or be bypassed.

<h2 id="conc">  Conclusion </h2>

<h3> Status of CAcert's Audit </h3>

<p>
Where are we?
</p>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Status - Clear</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Start doc review
    </li><li>
    Assurance can be checked in parallel
    </li><li>
    New roots - December?
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
<ul><li>
    CAcert has enough documentation to be analysed under
    DRC-A and DRC-B, for Assured Members.
    This can be started as early as December,
    and should be quick, once started.
  </li><li>
    Evaluation of Assurers in action
    will take longer;  but as this is an ongoing task, and the
    process is subject to continual quality improvement,
    this does not need to delay any other areas.
    As long as it moves forward, we can carry on.
  </li><li>
    New Root and new Individual Assurance subroot
    have to be created.  December.
  </li><li>
    However a number of critical acts remain undone which will block:
    <ul><li>
        Notification to all Members that they are now Members,
        under a new CAcert Community Agreement.
        An option to this is to close all un-notified accounts.
      </li><li>
        Addition of positive "I agree" checkboxes.
      </li><li>
        Turn-off of all the old Assurers.
    </li></ul>
    These are required to place the agreement into effect;
    without them CAcert lacks an agreement,
    is not a community, and all we have said so far has
    no foundation.
  </li><li>
    Resolution of the difficulties with email/domain probing,
    then completion of CPS into DRAFT.
    Probably one month after the previous point.
  </li><li>
 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Status - Blocking </b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Notifications, checkboxes, old Assurers
    </li><li>
    email/domain:  CPS
    </li><li>
    Security Manual work thru
    </li><li>
    Operational review:  Feb/Mar
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>
    Security Manual has to be completed.  November-December.
  </li><li>
    Systems have to be reviewed against SM and CPS.
    That will likely take some weeks or months.
</li></ul>

<p>
If all the above work out, we could see an <b>Audit Pass</b>
for the new root and subroot for Individual Assurance within
months.
</p>

<p>
Organisation Assurance has too many problems, so it will slide
until the team sort out a new document and resolve the bugs.
Unnamed certificates and non-assured certificates can happen
when the issues with email/domain checking are resolved.
</p>

<h3> Recommendations for All </h3>

<h4> What should Users do?  </h4>
 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Recommendations: Users</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Users should not ask for an audit
    </li><li>
    Instead, ask for offer + name
    </li><li>
    (CAs should also ask for name.)
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
Because of all the foregoing,
it is hard to recommend that users demand or rely on audits.
Neither over the vendors, nor the CAs, are audits
likely to tell them anything.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it suffices to do this:
demand a clear offering from the CA,
and demand to see the CA's name.
If each user can clearly seek remedy or satisfaction
for any action,
then we can use the traditional processes of brands
(beforehand)
and the courts (afterhand)
to improve the quality and provide the
needed security for a reasonable price.
</p>

<h4> What should CAs do?  </h4>

<p>
Listen to the above demand from users.
</p>

<p>
For the most part, this is all in place,
so CAs have little to do.
Most CAs have these agreements in place, and have
had them for years, because their own legal analysis
has said they are needed (and not the audits).
Indeed, some CAs have spent millions of dollars
on the legal work;  we should use this.
It simply
needs a change in the thought processes of the 
participants to shift from thinking about audits
to thinking about bilateral agreements.
</p>

<h4> What should Vendors do?  </h4>


 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Recommendations: Vendors</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Vendors:  direct audit to <i>their</i> end-users
    </li><li>
    R/L/O:  are vendor's liabilities clear?
    </li><li>
    Auditors -- how to add value to Users not payers?
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<p>
It is pointless to opine on the whether audits
should be demanded by vendors,
because they will anyway,
regardless of the logic or value.
Instead, I recommend that the vendors
<ol type="a"><li>
     direct the audit process to the benefit of
     the end-user
     <small>[<a href="#ref_29" name="back_29">29</a>]</small>, 

  </li><li>
     write their own audit criteria
       <small>[<a href="#ref_30" name="back_30">30</a>]</small>, 
  </li><li>
    disclaim liability for self and on part of
    the CA for any user who has not otherwise
    entered into an agreement with the user,
    and
  </li><li>
    get the brand name (CN) of the CA to the end-user,
    so the end-user can start playing a part in the
    governance of the CA.
</li></ol>

<br>

<h4> What should Auditors do?  </h4>

 <table align="right" border="1"><tr><td>
  <center><b>Recommentations: others</b></center>
  <ul><li>
    Vendors:  direct audit to <i>their</i> end-users
    </li><li>
    R/L/O:  are vendor's liabilities clear?
    </li><li>
    Auditors -- how to add value to Users not payers
    </li><li>
    Standards:  standardise the OODA loop
  </li></ul>
  </td></tr></table>

<br>
<p>
Ask how to deliver value to end-users.
</p>

<br>
<h4> What should Standards Committees do?  </h4>

<br>
<p>
The next great challenge for the
security committees is to standardise the OODA loop.
</p>

Practically, the limitation to zero is achieved by the
layering of many legal defences, not by some simple clause.

<p>

A further result of this is that the CA can show
an insurer that according to their legal defences, no
claim will ever pay out, and thus they are a good risk
for insurance.

It is worth noting at this point that CAcert had not
taken any steps to define either liability or parties.
This can be seen as both an endorsement of the audit
process to surface such a weakness, and as a benefit
for the CA in having a totally clean page on which
to craft its solution.

The CAcert story is somewhat unique, written by the
members of the Association, and might not present
a useful model to anyone else.
Especially, "form an association" is not necessarily
an absolute answer, as these carry a lot of costs in
management, which might also cause collapse.

    Like all security <i>silver bullets</i>,
    the real price for these devices is not the
    sticker price -- around $3000 to $10,000 per --
    but the project cost for the overall package.
    The total cost of ownership can be very high:
    the knowledge and work required to drive them,
    the knowledge required to certify them as secure
    (and certify any certifications they come with),
    the knowledge required to identify their weaknesses,
    and the work to address those in the wider security model,
    the hardware and systems that are required to deal with them,
    and the spares that need to available quickly on failure.

    For those interested, it is documented here:

    Basic deal is 9000 euros over 4 tranches,
    each tranch splitting evenly between three
    budgets:
    retainer, expenses, and "work needed by CA" components.
    As of today, two of the tranches are paid by NLnet.

This is not to say that other CAs were ignored.
Instead, they were treated as a final sanity check;
if their solutions looked like CAcert's solution,
then the check passed.  If they did not look like
CAcert's solution then the difference had to be
researched and understood before we moved on.
