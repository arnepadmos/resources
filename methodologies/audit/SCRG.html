<i>Note that as of May, 2000, this document is not getting a lot of
      attention as to the latest tricks to avoid.  Much of it is still 
      valid, but I suggest that you look elsewhere for an ultamately
      up-to-date list.</i>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
		Before programs may be placed in the firewall system,
the source code is reviewed for deficiencies in the areas of security,
reliability and operations.  This document is dual purposed; first it
is a guideline and checklist for security groups performing the code
review; second, it is an attempt to provide development teams with
information about what we look for in a review.<p> 

	This is an early draft of the guidelines; it is being
distributed in the hopes of providing a more transparent and
predictable code review process.  We do not mean to imply that the
things listed here are the only issues we will raise in a review.  We
will attempt to keep this document up to date, so that over time, it
becomes a more useful guide.</p><p>

<h4><li><a name="overview">Overview</a></li></h4>

	This document describes the code review portion of getting a
machine approved for connectivity outside of Acme Widgets.  The full
process is described in (). <p>

	When networking computers that can access information of
financial or personal value that Acme Widgets has entrusted to a computer
system, it is essential that we consider  information security.  When
network connections pass through networks outside of Acme Widgets's
control, we  are exposed to attacks from a variety of sources.  Those
sources are known to include vandals ("hackers") who will make changes
to information as a means of gaining prestige in the underground
community, or as a matter of revenge or disruption, and amateur
thieves, who will attempt to steal.  There may also be attacks by
professional criminals or criminal groups who have access to
substantial resources of both time and money, and can  perform an
in-depth attack.  Acme Widgets is a large, high visibility target...</p><p>

	As such, the firewall architecture group is tasked with
providing a state of the art Internet firewall that will protect us
from all these threats, and simultaneously help Acme Widgets provide
service to our customers over the Internet.  We are interested in
making it possible to deploy new applications that work over the
internet, however, we must make sure that those applications are
safe. </p><p>

	This means that we need to resist a variety of attacks, and we
need to do so <em>better</em> than in our phone or mail businesses.
Why better?  Because on the phone, there is a person in the loop.  In
the mail room, there is a person in the loop.  Online, it may be
possible to scale an attack from annoying to disastrous, or from a
small scam to a huge theft, because the entire attack might be
automated. </p><p>

	So it is with a healthy paranoia that we approach screening
new components to the firewall.  We will examine the authentication
and authorization methods that you use.  We will look for
confidentiality and integrity controls.  We will look at
administrative issues such as the documentation that the firewall
support group needs, and how the program logs.</p><p>

	This document, in addition to making the process transparent,
is intended to speed the code review process, by letting you know what
we'll be looking for, so you can have it ready when we do the review.
It also explains some of the coding practices and common mistakes that
we will insist be changed, so you can come to us with code thats
closer to being installable. </p><p>

	This is a requirements document.  In some places things will
	be marked <em>'optional'</em>, or <em>'preferred.'</em> This
	refers to a judgment call on the part of the Firewall
	Architecture group, with input from corporate security, the
	group whose code is being reviewed, and other participants in
	the code review process.  The word optional may be construed
	to mean that we will not require a change, although we may
	strongly recommend it.  Other things will be marked
	<em>'should,'</em> and those things are open to discussion, if
	they are documented design decisions.  In other words, the
	documentation must explain the choice at the start of the code
	review.  Otherwise, we will require that the code be changed
	to confirm with accepted security practices.</p><p>

	The code review participants should remain constant from
	review to review.  Participation by representatives from many
	groups is required for a successful code review.  Those groups
	include, but are not limited to, (Firewall Operations),
	(Firewall Architecture) and Corporate Security.  The code must
	be presented by a developer or group member who is qualified
	and able to answer technical questions about the code and
	design.  There must be a scribe and a coordinator appointed.
	At the end of a review, all present must agree on an appraisal
	of the code.  In the event of irreconcilable disagreements,
	the least positive appraisal that everyone can agree to will
	be the appraisal.  At reviews beyond the first, copies of the
	diffs and the minutes of all previous meetings should be
	available, along with a full copy of the current code.



</p><h4><li><a name="documentation">Documentation</a><p></p></li></h4>
<ol type="A">

	The code must be accompanied by documentation.  The
	documentation allows the review team to do a proper review,
	and provides the support people with information that they
	will need to run the code in the firewall environment.
	Templates for the architectural overview, code overview, and
	functional summaries will be made available.<p>

</p><h5><li>Architectural Overview</li></h5> 

      The review team will start with the architectural overview.
      This overview will include a diagram of the system being
      implemented, and the place of the code under review in the
      system.  The diagram should show the client, the proxy and
      server, all in relation to the Acme Widgets Firewall system.
      Data flow from (Corporate Network) to the server should be
      documented, as should how the client might relate to a firewall
      at the remote site.  The overview should also contain a textual
      description of the system, including a functional overview.  The
      functional overview must include information about what threats
      the code is expected to deal with, and how it will deal with
      them. The use of cryptography for confidentiality, integrity,
      etc should be outlined here. <p>

</p><h5><li>Code Overview</li></h5>

      Code reviews can be long and tedious.  Having to figure out how
      the code is designed, what modules will be compiled in, and
      other such information, obvious to the developer, will slow the
      process of code review while we wait for the overview
      information, and thus, deployment will be delayed. <p>

</p><h5><li>Comments in code</li></h5>
	We expect the code to have a reasonable number of comments.
As a guide, each file should have a comment at the start, explaining
what the code does, possibly a comment at the start of each function,
and comments as needed to explain complex or obfuscated code.
(Incidentally, a compilation of the per module header files might make
a good basis for an overview document, although it will not be a
complete overview.) <p>

</p><h5><li>Functional summary</li></h5>
	There must be a functional summary for the firewall support
group.  This documentation is expected at the time of review, and will
be evaluated as part of the review. <p>
</p><ol type="1">
	<em></em><li><em>Installation Requirements &amp; Environment</em><br>
	The install procedure must be documented.  Can we copy a
binary and a configuration file?  Do we need to run any scripts to set
up directory hierarchies?  What will the permissions and ownership be
on the installed files? <p>

	<em></em></p></li><li><em>How to invoke.</em><br>
	Does it run from the command line?  Inetd?  Cron?
Rc2.d/S99Acme?  Are there arguments that the program expects?
Does it expect environment variables to be set?  (We'd prefer they be
moved to a configuration file.  We might mandate some options be moved
to a configuration file for reliability reasons.)<p>

	<em></em></p></li><li><em>Signals</em><br>
	Does the program react to any signals other than SIGKILL and
SIGTERM?  If it does, it should use SIGUSR1 to activate  debugging,
and SIGUSR2 to turn it off.  In any event, the programs signal
handling must be documented. <p>

	<em></em></p></li><li><em>Options &amp; Configuration Files </em><br>
	A complete description of all command line options is
required.  A complete description of the configuration files is
required. <p>
</p></li></ol>
</ol>
<h4><li><a name="logging">Logging</a></li></h4>

	All programs in the firewall must call syslog to report a
variety of things.  Syslog is our standard way of getting log
information from the firewall to the analysis machines.  Information
to be logged includes, but is not limited to: Invocation, normal use
(including which machines and what is being done), problems, and the
program's termination, normal or abnormal.  Logging should be
configurable via a signal.  We strongly suggest use of SIGUSR1 to turn
on debugging, and SIGUSR2 to turn it off. <p>

	Programs must be careful to avoid logging passwords,
	cryptographic keys, and other sensitive data.  In addition, be
	careful about the amount of user supplied data that syslog
	gets.</p><p>

	Passing debugging information to syslog is optional.</p><p> 

	Log facility and levels to be used will be provided by (Firewall Architecture) on
	request.  In general, use LOG_INFO for information, LOG_DEBUG
	for debug, and LOG_ALERT, LOG_CRIT, and LOG_ERR when those are
	reasonably called for.

</p><h4><li><a name="files">Files</a></li></h4>
<ol type="A">
	<h5><li>Configuration files</li></h5><br>
	The program should read as much as is feasible from
configuration files; not have things such as host names hard-coded
into it.  (Hostnames, incidentally, should always be fully qualified.)
The file should be in a standard location (/usr/local/etc/acme/program
is strongly suggested), should have its ownership and permission
checked before reading, and should not be writable by the uid the
program is running under.  The config file should also specify the log
facility.  The config file should be treated like other incoming
data, on the chance that its been corrupted.<p>

	</p><h5><li>Core files</li></h5><br>
	Code on the firewall should attempt not to dump core if it
might have sensitive data in memory that could be retrieved.  Cores
might be made retrievable by an information (ftp, gopher, or web)
server running on the machine.  If the machine is a proxy server, we
can discuss the disposition of core files. <p>

	</p><h5><li>Chroot()</li></h5><br> The chroot() call irreversibly
	changes a programs view of the filesystem, creating a new
	'root,' usually within a tightly controlled 'jail' filesystem
	or partition.  This denies many useful tools to the attacker
	who has broken in, and is attempting to gain privledges.  Code
	that will need filesystem access should be able to run under a
	chrooted environment.  We will be invoking it from chrootuid.
	(Note that if your code runs with root privleges, or if there
	are buggy setuid tools available in the chroot area, a
	competent attacker can break out.<p>


	</p><h5><li>NFS</li></h5><br>
	Just say No File Security.<br>

	NFS uses 'client side' security, and has a host of security
problems associated with the portmapper, the way file handles are
generated, and thus should be avoided.

	<h5><li>Use Of setuid/setgid Permissions</li></h5><br>
	Giving code that runs on the firewall any privileges is
strongly discouraged, and use of privilege bits will cause much more
extensive scrutiny of the privileged code.  If you need privileges,
call seteuid() and setruid().  Also, consider putting all the
privilege in a single small program that does its one thing without
taking any arguments or user input.  (Example, a program that binds to
port 23 could be called port23, and execv(/usr/sbin/ftpd) after
setting its uid to nobody.) <p>

</p></ol>
<h4><li>	<a name="code-security">Code (Security Issues)</a></li></h4>
<ol type="A">
	<h5><li>Libraries</li></h5><br>
	There are a number of security related libraries that can
	provide some of the functions described below.  () is in the
	process of reviewing these libraries, and may be able to make
	a recommendation.  <p>

	</p><h5><li>Command Line</li></h5><br>
	The command line arguments of a program should be checked
	carefully, especially if the code is running with, or might be
	invoked with, privileges. <p>

	</p><h5><li>Data Checking</li></h5><br>
	Data coming in to Acme Widgets should be checked very carefully
	for appropriateness.  This check should be to see if the data
	is what is expected (length, characters). Making a list of bad
	characters is not the way to go; the lists are rarely
	complete.  A secure program should know what it expects, and
	reject other input. (For example, if you are looking for a
	host name, don't check to see if it contains a semi-colon or a
	newline, check to see if it contains anything other than a
	[A-Za-z0-9-] followed by a dot (period), followed by a
	hostname [A-Za-z0-9-].)  <a href="#appendix-b-mail">See
	Appendix B</a> for some comments on email address parsing.<p>

	It is not appropriate to assume that a connection is coming
	from the client that you expect, unless you take strong
	measures.  It very difficult to ensure that you are not
	talking to a bad guy.  Doing so requires that a connection use
	strong authentication up front and be encrypted and
	authenticated throughout its lifetime.</p><p>

	Even when this is done, there is a chance that a user might
find it worth attacking through an authenticated connection.  Consider 
verify the sanity of inbound data.</p><p>

	</p><h5><li>Confidentiality</li></h5><br>
	Data leaving the firewall should be checked for confidential
	Acme Widgets information, and most likely encrypted for
	confidentiality.<p>

	</p><h5><li>System Calls</li></h5><br>
    All system or library calls must have their return values checked, and
    errors handled.  Not checking the results of a system or library
    call is unacceptable.  The sole
    exception to this is that class of calls which are designed to
    either work or exit, and thus can not return failure.<p>

	Certain library calls have historically, been found to be
	associated with security problems, because they do no
	checking, and user input is often passed to them.  Use of
	these calls is strongly discouraged.  Those calls include but
	are not limited to,
</p><dl>
<dt>system</dt><dd> If there's user input in the arguments, the user might
be able to run a command. 

</dd><dt>exec, popen </dt><dt> Similar to system.  Use execl or execv, but be
careful not to pass user data to them without strong sanity checking.
</dt><dt>setuid and setgid </dt><dd>Programs shouldn't be able to use these
calls, because they shouldn't have any privileges.

</dd><dt>strcpy, strcat, sprintf
</dt><dd>don't check the length of the strings they're working with.  Use
strncpy, strncat.

</dd><dt>getenv </dt><dd>Can produce buffer overflows.  Also, watch for a
variable set two (or more!) times.

</dd><dt>gets, scanf</dt><dd>Improper bounds checking.  Use read, fgets

</dd><dt>gethostbyname, gethostbyaddr
</dt><dd> These, and other calls that
get data from the DNS, may return malicious data under the control of
a bad guy.  Getting a DNS server is pretty easy, as is having it
return 64k of data for your hostname, or returning a Acme Widgets address
instead of the real one.  Any time you're getting data from the DNS,
consider doing whats referred to as a double-reverse lookup, and
again, don't trust the data returned will be in a safe format, or
correct.  Code that correctly checks the information returned by the
dns can be found in the logdaemon package. 
</dd><dt>syslog

</dt><dd>If syslog is passed information derived from user input, be
careful to not overflow syslog's buffers.  The maximum buffer size to
pass is 1024 bytes.<p>
</p></dd><dt>realloc
</dt><dd>Realloc should not be used in crypto applications.  If memory
	contiguous to that already allocated is not available, realloc 
	will make a copy of the memory without zeroing the old bits.
	If this old memory contains keys, then you lose the pointer to 
	the memory without destroying the information.  This is
	generally considered a mistake.

</dd><dt>open
</dt><dd>The filesystem can change in ways you don't expect.  There is
	sample code in an appendix for how to call open and be sure
	you avoid tmp races, linking games, and other things.

</dd></dl>

<li><h5>Atomicity</h5><br>
	Many security holes are related to programmer expectations
that the flow of their program is uninterrupted. File access should be
atomic.  Temporary files, if they exist, should be created with
tmpfile(). <p>
</p></li></ol>

<h4><li><a name="code-reliability">Code (Reliability Issues)</a></li></h4>
<ol type="A">

<li>	System calls should have their return status checked.
</li><li>	Signals should be caught and handled.
</li><li>	Multithreaded code should use mutex() calls on globals.
</li><li>	C++ classes should have a constructor, destructor, (??)
</li><li>	Configuration information should be in a configuration file,
not hardcoded into the program.  See the section on configuration files.

</li><li>	The year 2000 is real soon now.  Leap years happen every four
years.  Daylight savings may move the clock back an hour annually. 
</li><li>	Functions should perform bounds checking.
</li><li>	umask should be set to a restrictive value.
</li><li>    UIDs should never be -1, which can sometimes happen if you
	have insufficient type strength, or otherwise try putting UID
	65535 in a short.

</li></ol>
<a name="testing">
<h4><li>Testing</li></h4></a>
<ol type="A">
	During the process of writing code, it should be tested for
functionality and security.  These tests should be made available to
the review team, preferably in the form of a script.  Tests should
look for things such as buffer overflows, proper dataflows, resistance
to unusual input (control characters, for example), off-by-one loop
errors, possible unterminated loop situations, etc. <p>


</p><h5><li>Compiler Checking</li></h5> 

The code must be run through available tools for code quality checking, such as lint or perl -w.  See the <a href="#appendix-a">language notes.</a>

<h5><li>Testing Tools</li></h5>
	We will work with the code's authors to produce a set of stress tests.


</ol>
<h4><li>Miscellaneous</li></h4>
<ol type="A">
<h5><li>Code size</li></h5>
	The programs running in the firewall should be kept to a
	minimum of size and functionality, because all code, even when
	we're done reviewing it, has bugs.  The more code there is,
	the more bugs there will be.  The more bugs there are, the
	more security related bugs there will be.  Thus, we want the
	smallest code that is reasonable for the job.  The code should
	also be kept simple and straightforward.

<h5><li>Revision Control</li></h5>
	The code must be under revision control.  RCS or similar log
	messages and version numbers must be in the code and available
	from <em>strings(1)</em>.  Revision based differential
	information must be available.

<h5><li>Code Formatting</li></h5>

      All code will be run through a standard formatter before review,
      and printed with file names, line and page numbers on each page.
      Lines will be formatted to wrap at a reasonable length.  We
      suggest the use of the unix command "fmt FILE | vgrind | lpr" or
      "pr -n | mpage -2 -f | lp".  The presenter of the code is
      responsible for providing the coordinator with the code in paper
      and electronic form at least one full day before a review.

<h5><li>Code ownership</li></h5>
      (Firewall Architecture) and (Firewall Operations) will take ownership of the code once it is frozen.
      It will be kept in an archive in a buildable form.  The binaries
      from this code will be installed as per the install
      instructions.  Cryptographic checksums of the code should be
      recorded with code version numbers.


<h5><li>Strong Authentication</li></h5>
      Strong authentication should be used on all connections.
      Contact (Firewall Architecture) for a list of supported authentication methods.  All
      authentication should be managed by the TIS authmgr.<p>

<ol type="A">
<h5><li>C</li></h5>

The code must <em>lint(1)</em> cleanly.  It must be compilable with
-Wall or equivalent without warnings.  It should pass an extended
memory checker, such as Purify or Electric Fence.  Flexlint should
also be used for checking.

Initial revision

<h5><li>C++</li></h5>

As C.

<h5><li>Perl</li></h5>

The code must run cleanly under perl -Tw.  The T option directs perl
    to use its taint checking mode, and -w is warnings.  Also, the
    directive "use strict" causes perl to catch more problems in the
    code.
<p>

Also, be aware of the null byte issue when passing things to system
      calls: Perl allows nulls in strings, C does not, which can lead
      to interesting behavior.  See Phrack 55-07 for details.

<a name="appendix-b"><h3><li>Application Notes</li></h3></a>
<ol type="A">
<h5><li>cgi-bin</li></h5>
      Lincoln Stein form library
<h5><li><a name="appendix-b-mail">Mail addressing</a></li></h5>

      There are a wide variety of legal email address formats.  We
      strongly advise that a paranoid, minimalist approach in choosing
      what to accept.  This will cut off some subset of customers, but
      most people have available to them Internet style
      (user@host.net) addressing.  The issue of how to handle unusual
      email address is a design decision.  If an unusual address is
      passed, it may have repercussions later when some other bit of
      code expects internet addressing.  You might consider some form
      of verification for bizarre addresses.<p>

Legitimate address formats include:
</p><pre>     user_name@company.com
     alex+@pitt.edu
     mi%aldan.UUCP@algebra.com
     user%host.domain@anon.penet.fi
     host1!host2!user
     /G=JABYML/S=MASONS/O=CUSTOMER/ADMD=FOOBAR/C=KZ/@gateway.sprint.com
     "JE Jones"@foo.x.400.net

<h5><li>nsapi</li></h5>
<h5><li>Proxy</li></h5>

If you choose to write a new proxy, we recommend using a process model if
the typical session will last more than a few seconds.  The speed gain
from threading is outweighed by the increased complexity, and that gain
is amortized over the life of a process.

<h5><li>DCE</li></h5> 
We like DCE's strong authentication.  DCE RPCs without authentication
and authorization are not useful.

<h5><li>Cryptography</li></h5>
<ul type="bullet">

<li> You must use standard algorithms.  No algorithm not subjected
to extensive public peer review will be accepted.
</li><li> You should use standard protocols wherever possible.  PKCS message
formats are good.
</li><li>  Use standard implementations, don't recode algorithms or protocols.
</li><li>  Understand the difference between authentication, privacy, and non-repudiation.
</li></ul>

<a name="open"><h3><li>Calling Open</li></h3></a>

It turns out that calling open() can be tricky.  This code was
    provided by Peter Guttmann to handle cases where the filesystem is 
    changing underneath you.

<p>
<a href="http://www.security-express.com/archives/bugtraq/2000-01/0012.html">18
 July 2006: Note that this doesn't work quite as wella s you'd like.  
See http://www.security-express.com/archives/bugtraq/2000-01/0012.html 
for details."</a>

    /* Under Unix we try to defend against writing through links, but this is
       somewhat difficult since the there's no atomic way to do this, and
       without resorting to low-level I/O it can't be done at all.  What we
       do is lstat() the file, open it as appropriate, and if it's an
       existing file ftstat() it and compare various important fields to make
       sure the file wasn't changed between the lstat() and the open().  If
       everything is OK, we then use the lstat() information to make sure it
       isn't a symlink (or at least that it's a normal file) and that the
       link count is 1.  These checks also catch other weird things like
       STREAMS stuff fattach()'d over files.

       If these checks pass and the file already exists we truncate it to
       mimic the effect of an open with create.  Finally, we use fdopen() to
       convert the file handle for stdio use */
